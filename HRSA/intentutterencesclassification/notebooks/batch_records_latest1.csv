"Good afternoon!

My name is Jasmin Fosheim. I'm an economic developer and grant writer in Hettinger, North Dakota.
 

I'm reaching out because I'm working with a small business here in Hettinger who provides in-home physical therapy to a large region within and beyond Hettinger. This service has been vital to our community, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability of older clients to travel. They are running into financial hardship, however, because of the number of windshield hours required to reach their clients. Although they can get comp-ed for mileage, their windshield time is not billable.
 

That said, they are looking for any support there might be for this specific area in which they are spending too much time and money with little return. Is there any chance you know of any programs they might be eligible for or organizations that might be able to provide support for this business model?

Thanks in advance for your time. Take care, Jasmin."
