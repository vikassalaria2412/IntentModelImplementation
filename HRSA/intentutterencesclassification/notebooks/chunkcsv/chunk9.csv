I reached out to Tier 2 on 2/16/2021 on behalf of a grantee (H1GRH27375) in order to inquire about problems they were having receiving EHB communications. The email I sent is pictured below. (See attachment) 

I was told that I would need to make certain changes in order for them to receive EHB communications. I followed the directions as they were presented to me and sent a successful test email to the grantee contact. We thought the problem had been resolved there, but yesterday a new NoA was released for their grant and the contact in question (Gail Nowosadko; gnowosadko@salud.unm.edu) was still not CC?d on the email. I am now reaching out to ask what more I can do to resolve this, or if there is some error in EHB preventing her from receiving these correspondences?

The most important question everyone has is: ""what is next?""

The short answer is a newly listed NASDAQ crypto mining company from Canada.

Rumours have it that Elon Musk or Tesla might have or is going to acquire a stake in this newly listed NASDAQ.

Many are waiting for his ""infamous"" tweets to send stock price soaring.

With all the talk about going green, this newly listed Bitcoin and Ethereum mining company is a green company that mines bitcoin and ethereum using green energy.

It is currently trading at less than USD$3.50 in NASDAQ, way lower than it's all time high in 2018. And Bitcoin and Ethereum have broken their all time high, making this stock highly undervalued.

This company is Canadian company Hive Blockchain. You can check out their stock here:
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hvbtf

Rumours have it that Elon Musk or Tesla has taken a stake in this company which just listed on NASDAQ on 1st July 2021.

"I serve as the Project Officer on Grant Number X10MC33612.  I am submitting this request on behalf of the awardee, the Utah Department of Health.

 

During HRSA?s review of Utah?s FY19 MIECHV Final Report, the awardee changed MIECHV Project Directors.  The former PD is Kat Bark.  The new PD is Elizabeth Vansant-Webb. 

 

The former PD submitted the original version of the report, but it is up to the new PD to make revisions and upload the final version of the report.  The final version of the report is now due for submission in response to my EHB Change Request (see screen shot below).  However, the new PD does not have ?submission? privileges because EHB still lists the former PD as FY19 award PD and as the only person who can submit documents for that grant.  

 

The Utah Authorizing Official (AO) tried to submit the report, but was told that the listed PD (former PD Kat Bark) must first grant access to the AO.  However, neither the former nor the previous PD are comfortable with the former PD (who is now a HRSA employee) logging into her old Utah account.

 

Next, Utah attempted to submit a PAR to make Elizabeth Vansant-Webb the PD for the FY19 award, as she has done for the FY20 and FY21 awards.  However, EHB won?t let her submit a PAR because the FY19 is an inactive grant.  Here is the message she received when she tried:

 

Grant Number X10MC33612 expired on 09/29/2021 and a Prior Approval Request for a Project Director Change may not be requested. For questions, please contact the Grants Management Specialist listed on the Notice of Award.

 

Is it possible for Tier 2 Support to update Elizabeth Vansant-Webb?s EHB account to indicate her as the PD for Grant Number X10MC33612 or otherwise enable her to submit the final version of the report? 

 

Thank you, and please let me know if you need more information.

Detailed Description of the issue:
The North/Central Florida GWEP team funded by Grant Number U1QHP28709 has ""junk characters"" in the PC-1, LR-1a, LR-2, DV-1, DV-2, and DV-3 sections for our training programs. Although we are still able to enter data and have the EHB save it, we are unable to validate each section in the APR entirely because of this issue, which we need to do prior to final submission.  

While doing a test population on our Performance Data Forms for this year, we also noticed that the inactive training programs from last GWEP cycle have disappeared. This seemed odd because multiple members of our team remember seeing them in the EHB system last week. The programs generating the junk characters seem to be current REACH training programs. 

We were not experiencing this issue with junk characters last week while working on the initial setup for our training programs. When the EHB system deleted the inactive entries from last GWEP cycle this past week, this issue may have arisen around the same time.

Please see screenshot attached"
