Caller had a few questions in reference to claims.
"Hello -

FUHN/NHCN is a current HCCN grantee and we plan to submit an application for the American Rescue Plan funding due on June 28, 2021.   Our former Project Director, Dawn Plested, left her position on May 11, 2021 and I am the interim director.  I changed Project Director status last month; my name is Ellen Benavides.

In addition to submitting our application before June 28th, I tried to download all of our contracts for our 2020 audit yesterday and EHB said that ""I do not have privileges to view these item and should contact the Authorizing Official to request access.?   

I contacted Alita Geri Carter, our Program Officer and Hernan Truque, our Grants Management Specialist and they told me I need to connect with the Help Desk to gain access to our grants and get a ticket number and forward to them.  

I look forward to hearing from you.  

Thanks.

"Good morning,	

My name is Morgan and when I came across your website, I was very impressed! A mesothelioma diagnosis comes with many complications. Aside from the cancer itself, other problems like mental health can make the process even more complicated. The most common mental health conditions in cancer patients include anxiety, depression, and coping issues. A study by Psycho-Oncology found nearly 25 percent of cancer patients experience symptoms of depression. Sadly, 75% of cancer-related suicides are patients with depression. 

It's important for patients and their families to know there are support groups and other resources to help them in their time of need. Studies show that cancer patients and their families who utilize therapy and support groups are less likely to turn to substance abuse or self-harm. For these reasons, we would love to be featured on your site. So please, let me know if you would add www.mesotheliomahub.com/mesothelioma/complications/mental-effects/ to your page; mchb.hrsa.gov/whusa13/health-status/health-indicators/p/life-expectancy.html, with the anchor text ?Mesothelioma & Depression.? I think our website could be a beneficial resource for your visitors. 

Thanks for the work you do to help others and feel free to contact me with any questions."

"Hello, 
I am a former employee from an FQHC in Grand Junction, CO; MarillacHealth. I had suspicions that the organization was misusing funds, specifically the School based health center grant. I have a few questions regarding both grants and the organization. 
1. Are FQHC board meetings open to employees and the public? My understanding is that as a public entity, those meetings are. I repeatedly asked to attend these meetings and was denied access. My intentions were to listen to what false information was being reported to the board. 

2. How does HRSA check on the organization following grant guidelines? My complaint was that we were hired and paid through the SBHC grant, yet we were doing tasks for the clinic which was outside of the SBHC grant. I did verify with the state of Colorado that this was a violation of grant guidelines. 

3. How do I submit any complaints to HRSA regarding the mishandling of funding and discrimination treatment I received at my employment, resulting in my unfair termination?

43 What are the rules for contacting the Media regarding these allegations, as well as the results of the state audit for such mishandling of funds which affect students the grant was meant to serve?
If someone could please get in touch with me and fist answer these in writing and then call if needed, I would greatly appreciate it.

Grantee needed assistance with locating Revised Budget
"Good afternoon,

 

BPHC is only funding 25 of over 300 applications for 21-093. This competition was very competitive with scores being a one-hundredth of a point apart.  But, this would mean all funded would have a score of 100 or 99.

Double checking to make sure  we can give BPHC assurance that we have validated both normalized ROLs before they decide if they will use the normalized or raw version for making awards. We want to make sure that there were no weird z-score anomalies for the EHB or ARM ROLs for HRSA-21-093 due to the number of applications with scores over 100 on the EHB ROL. 

 

Both the EHB and ARM normalized ROLs are attached to this email. I will need your verification by tomorrow if at all possible and I thank you for your help.  

 

Please let me know if you have any questions."

If we are an FQHC in Ohio, is it acceptable to credential our OH FQHC facility as a medical clinic in Indiana so we may be reimbursed under straight Medicaid and to see Indiana patients?

"Hi, I wanted to know how the contract works. I am currently employed at NYU Langone Brooklyn Hospital as a dental hygienist. I was initially hired with NYU in their school based clinics but now because schools are not open due to the pandemic, I am transferred in the outpatient setting at the hospitals for the underserved and community based clinics. I wanted to know if I have eligible for this reward if applied. I was hired 2/24/2020 and I believe the application stated it is a two year contract. Would this be a two year contract from a employer HRSA is deciding on or would my current employer be eligible? Is this also the same as the PSLF program as well? Thank you.
