"Hello,
I had computer issues when entering information into Reporting period 2 of the PRF. Therefore I am not sure of what data was supposed to be pre-populated from reporting period 1, into reporting period 2. 
I have called on this several times, and have received conflicting information, as well as seeing different information in the guides, within the portal and on HRSA's website. 

Since the period of availability for each reporting period goes back to January 1, 2020, I am not sure whether or not the expenses that were reported in period one, were carried forward into period 2 (Pre-populated into period 2). 

I am respectfully requesting advanced assistance on this, as my multiple calls have not provided clear answers. I have received different answers, from different customer service representatives. 

Thank you in advance,

Debbie McNamara, please email to:  dmcnamara@cgphysicaltherapy.com"

"Hello. I am a PhD student in Business. I am currently doing a research on telehealth and I have been using the UDS data from your website. I have a question about the telehealth implementation reports of organizations. I found that under one grant (Health Center), there may be multiple sites (Health Center Sites). For instance, the 'Health Center' may be 'City of Springfield, Massachusetts' and has a grant number 'H80CS00001'. There are multiple health center sites such as 'City of Springfield Adolescent Health Center', 'Craig's Door', 'Franklin County Emergency Shelter'. 

When Health Centers report that they have telehealth in their organization, does this mean that all the sites they manage have telehealth or that at least one site has telehealth? I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you."

Detailed description of the Issue

Description

Hello, I am the project officer for MIECHV grant X10MC32211, the awardee is Prevent Child Abuse North Dakota.

The DGIS task number is DG00001661, and this is a New Competing Performance Report for the grant.

Financial Form 1 of the report, Line 2, Unobligated balance, states ?$600,000? which is incorrect. This value should be zero. Can you please update the value to zero?

 

I mistakenly approved this report when it was submitted and did not see the erroneous value.

I believe that updating Line 2 UOB to zero will change other related values in the report:

Form 1 - 5. Total Project Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045), 7. Total Collaborative Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045)

Form 2 ? the table showing Unobligated balance (change from 600,000 to zero), Total Project Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045), Total Federal Collaborative Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045)

However, if the cascading fields do not update automatically, can you please change those values as well?

Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Thank you!

Hi Nicole,

It is in my queue, but I can't edit it.
See screenshots below.  When I click on ""edit"", it opens it up, and I can see the entire report, but I can only view, not edit.  The other clue is that when I click ""edit"", the tab that opens up is titled ""print report"", which is consistent with how it's acting.

Hi Nicole,

I see now that the change from 784 to 748 looks suspicious (!) and like a mistake, but it was intentional.  We had one site close down as of December 31, 2020 which decreased our capacity by 36 families.  I put a comment about it in the comments section (I'll copy the comment below).

One of our PAT agencies closed as of 12/31/2020. This reduced our staffing by 6 (4 home visitors, 1 clinical supervisor and 1 program manager, counted here under ""other""). It reduced our over program capacity by 36, from 784 households to 748 households.

I can see that the report is still live in the handbook-- is there anything else you want me to add?  Or should I just submit it again?

Connie

Description:

Grantee states she is trying to validate the last entry in the INDGEN-PY section of her Performance Report.  She is receiving an error message that another user has already updated the section and that the current data has been loaded to the page. The error won't let her save and validate to proceed with the report. She is receiving the error in the INDGEN-PY

Replicate:

Logged into Testing/OS and confirmed that the INDGEN-PY Section is the only section that is incomplete.

Conducted Screenshare with Grantee.  In the INDGEN-PY section, all the rows have complete data except Row 124.  The Grantee entered data for Columns 13,14,16,17, and 18, though when Save and Validate is selected, a validation error appears that Columns 13,14, 16, 17, 18 need data entered (even though data was just entered).

Tried entering N/A for all fields for Row 124 to bypass the row and same error message results.

Restarted computer and switched browsers and the same error message results.

Added the Grantee's Superviser, Samantha Lawson, also with permission to work on grant, to the screenshare.  Initially she received the same error as above, however she was able to save column 13 and 14 when she clicked Save and Validate.  Columns 16, 17, and 18 are still not saving, when save is clicked.

Also found that in the ""Edit Form"" of the section, the data is visible for all columns for Rows 1 to 123, however, when in ""Review"" mode, the data is not viewable in Columns 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 for rows 51 to 123.

The submission due date is 3/31/22 and no Extension Request is available in the EHB

I am submitting this request from MCHB, as a medium priority ticket and requesting resolution by next Wednesday (July 7th).  I am the point of contact (Michelle Tissue ? Mtissue@hrsa.gov).

 

Description of Issue:

I am having trouble with a submitted PPER - DG00004944 ? under grant number T76MC00011. I received a blank system e-mail saying the report had been submitted (e-mail attached ? this is similar to an issue flagged by one of my colleagues) and my EHB tasks queue also indicates I have a DGIS performance report to review that is in ?Not Started? status (first screen shot below). However, when I proceed to my DGIS task queue, nothing appears. I have tried to toggle the ?search? setting on the task list to include all FY, all states, all types of reports and nothing shows up that needs review. The only reports that appear are previously submitted/cleared reports from previous reporting periods (see second screen shot below). Am I missing something?

 





 

When I look in the grant folder, it does say the report was submitted and that HRSA Review is ?In Progress? ? but I haven?t been able to locate or start reviewing the report.

 



 

I appreciate any assistance you can provide in resolving this issue.

 

Thanks!
Michelle
