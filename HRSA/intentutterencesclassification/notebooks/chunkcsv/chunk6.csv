"Hi,

Can an individual apply for a grant via your organization?  I have an interest in applying for a grant that would allow consumers of health care to more easily compare prices of health care services/procedures between competitor hospitals.

Hospitals are required to publish a fee schedule for services that is viewable by the public.  These fee schedules are based on procedure codes that the general public is not familiar with,  and the presentation of such fees schedules varies hospital to hospital.  It makes it very difficult for a lay consumer to compare competitor hospital prices.  I would like to apply for a grant that would support the building of a mechanism accessible by the general public that breaks down competitor hospital fee schedules at a level where the coding is translated to an index health care consumers can understand, and that aligns mutually exclusive hospital fee schedules by service for an easier comparison between two or more hospitals.

The mechanism I have in mind would be an interactive database at a website holding all hospital fee schedules, where a consumer could select specific hospital names or designate a geographical service area (most likely by county or zip), and then be presented with an indexed, decipherable fee schedule with each hospital going across the columns and the service/procedure types as the rows.  The data would be each hospital?s fee.  The procedures would have links where consumers could drill down for more detail.  There would be a defined procedure for updating the database on a routine basis, to control for hospital updates to fee schedules.

The ultimate goal in applying for a grant would be to increase health care service price transparency, which was the driver behind requiring hospitals to provide fee schedules to begin with.  A fringe benefit of creating this mechanism is once the public has the ability to put a hospital?s fee schedule to use, hospitals would be incentivized to provide more price competitive services.  At present, no one is using these fee schedules.  Hospital?s would also have incentive to fill in any holes with regard to services provided on the fee schedule.  There would literally be a null in the data for any hospital service without a provided price estimate (assuming a competitor hospital listed a fee for the service).

I am currently unemployed, but have worked in hospital decision support analytics for almost 20 years.  I have a friend who is a coding guru and we would like to team up for this.  We both are excited at the prospect of pursuing this project as it would be groundbreaking in transitioning power to the health care consumer.

Thanks for your help and any insight!
