Grantee needed assistance with FFR
"CHGME awardees/grantees received both precertification and certification tasks within the EHB. Both tasks were sent to the incorrect user, not the AO that certified the CHGME initial application during the same year. Most were sent to the PD and others to non-CHGME users within the organization. The pre-certification and certification of the pre-certification and certification tasks are therefore incorrect and inconsistent with the other documentation include in the FTE assessments. Basically, the wrong person, the person without authority pre-certified/certified the task. Therefore, these completed tasks need to be deleted/scrubbed from the EHB."

Date of Incident: 4/13
Brief Detailed Description:  Good morning. We have been contacted by someone at HRSA that our CEO is appearing in the EHB 27 times as Authorized Official. We are requesting assistance cleaning up our users and roles. Notably, we want to be sure that if we remove an instance of our CEO appearing 27 times, that this wouldn't remove her from listing as AO on the actual grant/award/submission. We are also concerned others could be listed multiple times and multiple roles. Can you advise as to how I can streamline / fix our users and roles without impacting an existing award? 
Thank you in advance for any assistance. - Sam Halloran hallorans@bnhc.org
Steps to Replicate: User is stating Susan Joss is appearing on the users list 27 times should only appear once. Emailed user to get a screenshot of the error, user could not provide that, I found their organizations Primary AO Linda Gabruk and logged in as them to acquire a screenshot. (screenshot attached) Not sure on how to get those items removed from the list, if the user selects remove would that remove the user completely.

The 2019 reporting period for the RSR is now listed as active. It should only be 2020. Was this due to the update on the HIVQM which is attached to the RSR?

Obviously I can't go into detail but it helps healthcare. A friend told me I should apply for a grant to see if I can get funding to help with the fees to build the software. I am just now starting to look into if this is even a possibility. Can you point me in the right direction?

"Hello,

The PQC approved the site visit report. What is supposed to happen is EHB pulls the external site visit report into the module, which is then sent to the grantee. There is a known malfunction with this process, but when I used it two weeks ago, it worked. Below is the EHB-generated email that the grantee received this morning with only the cover letter (no report). What does initiating mean?

Please find the final site visit report for H80CS06674 (Initiating). The details of the site visit are as follows.

Organization Name, City, State: Los Angeles Christian Health Centers, LOS ANGELES, CA
Entity Number:H80CS06674 (Initiating)
Site Visit Tracking #:SV-008920
Site Visit Date(s):12/15/2020 - 12/17/2020
Additional Comments:
BPHC requests a standard, comprehensive Operational Site Visit (OSV) to thoroughly review the financial, clinical, and admin/governance operations at the health center and to assess health center compliance with Health Center Program Requirements. The OSV also should evaluate the health centers clinical performance and provide recommendations for performance improvement pertaining to the health centers clinical performance.
