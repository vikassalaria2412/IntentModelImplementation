Grant Number: H80CS00244

Date of Incident:03/02/201

Brief Detailed Description: Grantee needed assistance with creating an account however the system says her username (vmiles@rphcc.org) already exist so she created an account using an alternative email address (Vlmiles03@gmail.com) and when she tried to update her email address, the system says there is an account with her email (vmiles@rphcc.org).

Steps to Replicate: I searched for an account for the user by the email address and found an account under Kim Taylor so I asked user if she knew Kim and she said yes. I reset the password to her email (vmiles@rphcc.org) and she logged into the EHB but she was prompted to register to the organization however she got a warning that she cannot register to the organization. Vera informed me that Taylor has been removed from the organization therefore the email address ((vmiles@rphcc.org) has been removed and if she needs to register to the organization with that username, it would have to be added back to the organization. Vera needs her email available to her so she can update her alternative email (Vlmiles03@gmail.com) address to her work email. Marie advised me to escalate it.

"Hello, 
We are greatly concerned that EHB will be unavailable the entire weekend just 10 days before the UDS due date and ask that HRSA reconsiders this shut down time in light of the need for grantees to work in EHB over the weekend before such a major deadline. 

Like all health centers Trillium Health has been dealing with the strain of COVID, vaccine distribution, staff shortages due to illness and now particularly related to vaccine side effects. Because of these factors our typical timeline and staffing for doing the UDS this year has been impacted and we had hoped to do work over this weekend to upload data in EHB to gain back some ground. We like to upload the data and work on all the cross table edits before our C-suite staff review the submission. this way nothing, or only minor data changes are made between their review and our submission. 

As you can imagine, learning that the EHB is closed all weekend in this context is very stressful for us and so I wanted to take a few minutes to share this frustration with you that a major EHB outage would be planned before such a major Health Centre deadline. 

If there is a way to postpone this EHB update until after the UDS is due that would be ideal or conduct the update in over-night times possibly. 

Respectfully, 
Amy Mihalakas

"Hello,

I have a general question regarding subawards.  I have a PI that is a dual employee (co-funded between the University and the hospital).  They have been given a HRSA grant through the University, however, part of the scope of work will be conducted at the hospital.  The PI wants to know if they can use a subaward to ""sub"" the work to themselves to complete the portion of work completed at the hospital.  In this scenario, they would be listed as the PI for the University and as the PI for the Subaward.  I believe this would be a conflict of interest, because the PI would be approving their own invoices/work produced from the hospital, however, I'm unable to find any clear guidance in your policy manual that discusses this specific situation.  

I've also read through Uniform Guidance.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
Tiffany"

https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/by-address

I have noticed that finding by address uses geocoding, which the site itself deems as not 100% accurate. 
The geocoding shows that this is not an MUA, but the mua-find shows that Hartford is. 

Would someone be able to tell me which would be the best tool to use, and if there is any additional information that HRSA can provide?

My name is Michelle and I am a PA in Iowa.  I currently work in a critical access hospital in Sioux County, IA.  The hospital tells me they are approved for HRSA.  Can you tell me what the ""Need"" number is for this area and if it is worth filling out the application?  Several years ago I filled this out and it literally took me and my husband both working on it for several hours over a week to get it done just to find out that my site had it's need number lowered after I turned it in.  That was so disappointing.  The name of the town I am in is Hawarden, Iowa, if that is helpful.

I would really like to hear back from you.

I wonder if you would be able to share these 2012 and 2013 NPI files that we need for a research project at the RAND Corporation. We have a FTP site that allows data transmission. Thanks a lot!

Grantee wants be to sure that the fields in the report already completed are not erased during the edit.

 

The Core 1/Tier 2 objectives should match the ?aims? in Form 6 but currently there are no aims in Form 6 or objectives in Core 1.

 

The goal is that these aims/objectives are pulled from the NOFO and consistent across programs (for Form 6 and Core 1 objectives) . It does not look like the back-end pre-population happened with programs that were mid-project period when the new DGIS rolled out.

"Re 01172832 	
Ticket was escalated already 

A Project in our ARP (Capital) Grant was changed from Alteration/ Renovation to Construction/Expansion. 
The correction was made on project 190779-10, but the site froze while working on Form 5B, picking a site from scope and the site was not added.
When I tried to add the site again, it said the site was already in use, although it was not showing up.
So I deleted project 190779-10 and created 190779-11. But I still cannot add the project site, because it still says it is already in use.

I think there is something in the queue or someplace else that shows the site is being used even through it is not.

The site I need to add to 190779-11 is 3136 West Street.
The other two sites are okay as they are (3158 West St and 1151 Washington St)."
