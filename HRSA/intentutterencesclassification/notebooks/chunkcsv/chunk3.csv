Somehow the NA module of E13 HPSL Pharmacy generates a wrong grant number for Massachusetts University. The system shows its grant number as E4CHP32084 while the correct number should be E13HP21726 (please see the screenshot below for more detail). Please take a look at the issue and fix it ASAP so we can move forward with the process.

"I am writing to inquire about the Scholarships for Disadvantaged (SDS) Program, offered through HRSA Health Workforce. Specifically, I am interested in learning how to add the Orthotics and Prosthetics discipline as an eligible applicant/recipient, and offer the following facts to support inclusion in this program:
? Since 2013, Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services (PSAS) obligations have increased by 67%. In that same time period, the number of veterans served by PSAS has increased by 21%. In 2019, approximately 55% of all veterans treated by the VHA received devices provided by PSAS, a substantial number of which received devices and services provided by orthotic and prosthetic practitioners.*
? The need for qualified orthotists and prosthetists is projected to grow 17% in the next 10 years, much faster than the average for all occupations (4%)**.
? The fast growth will result in approximately 1,700 new jobs over the 10-year period**; however, that number only represents new openings and does not account for the attrition created by current practitioners who will reach retirement age, which will add approximately 1,500 more jobs by 2029.    
? The discipline serves a diverse population with unique and specialized needs, and therefore requires a highly skilled and trained practitioner. In 2012, in recognition of the increasingly complex knowledge and skillset needed of practitioners, the profession raised the entry-level education requirement from a bachelor?s degree to a master?s degree. 
? Currently, only 12 institutions nationally offer the entry-level educational degree (master?s), with an average cost of in-state tuition of $57,038 and an average out-of-state tuition of $69,092; tuition ranges from a low of $33,3570 to a high of $105,789***. It is important to note that these costs represent tuition and fees only. 
? Programs are typically full-time and cohort based. The required curriculum includes didactic, laboratory, and clinical rotation experiences, thereby necessitating small cohort sizes.
? There is a critical need for greater diversity in the profession, yet the cost of tuition is prohibitive to potential students from disadvantaged backgrounds who would otherwise qualify for admission into the programs.      

The International Institute of Orthotics and Prosthetics (IIOP) was founded in 2016 and is the profession?s only independent O&P educational facility. Enrollment has steadily increased since its first cohort started in January 2019 and is expected to accommodate two new cohorts (24 students per cohort) each academic year, with a total enrollment of 72 students enrolled concurrently in the 16-month program.
? IIOP tuition is $51,993 and is below the average cost of other programs? in-state tuition. IIOP tuition is the same for all students, whether in-state (Florida) or out-of-state.
? IIOP serves as a testing center for the American Board of Certification of Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics; 200 practitioner candidates spend 32 days each year validating their knowledge and skills through the comprehensive certification exam process.  
? IIOP is located in the Tampa Bay (Florida) area and is within miles of major O&P providers, such as Shriners Hospital for Children, James A. Haley Veteran?s Hospital, and Bay Pines VA Healthcare System. Our partnerships reach across the United States, enabling our students to minimize the cost of their clinical experiences through placements in their home states (e.g., Children?s Healthcare of Atlanta, and the Hanger Clinic). 
? The master?s program at IIOP is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), and the National Commission of Orthotic and Prosthetic Education (NCOPE). The institute is currently seeking accreditation through the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC).    
? IIOP is home to the Veterans Stride Foundation, a non-profit organization that serves as a resource center for educators, researchers, practitioners, and patients. The Foundations seeks to improve the lives of amputees, veterans, and their families by enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of the practitioners who serve them.  The Foundation sponsors adaptive sports and events in the community to enhance the lives of amputees and veterans.   

I am hopeful that the information provided above is adequate justification for adding the Orthotics and Prosthetics discipline to the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Program. Through this program, we will be able to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds and continue to produce highly effective and caring practitioners to those in need. 

Please let me know what the next steps are in this process."

All of the above programs/grants have to be linked to the SV module so any individual reviewing the grants will be able to see that HRSA performed their review.

"Good Morning,

 
Currently, there are 3 site visit tasks in my EHB task queue that are invalid; therefore, the tasks cannot be processed. The site visit tracking #?s are SV-008546, SV-009297 and SV-008549.

I am requesting the expedited removal of the aforementioned tasks, to help ensure that my EHB task queue reflects only current and valid tasks.

Â·         SV-008546 pertains to LAL ? Edgewater System?s Performance Improvement site visit. The site visit task includes fiscal, clinical and governance TA on the same Performance Improvement Site visit module. Note however, it was determined by the leadership team that SV-008546 had to be cancelled and 3 separate TA types were created for clinical, governance and fiscal (see attachment). As such, SV-008546 is invalid.

Â·         SV-009297 pertains to LAL ? Edgewater System?s site visit that was initially postponed by the program office due to the pandemic. Edgewater?s vOSV was tentatively rescheduled for June 23-25, 2021 (as reflected in the ONHS-NMD site visit plan). SV-009297 however remains in my task queue.

Â·         SV-008549 pertains to Ironton Lawrence County?s site visit, which was initially postponed by the program office, due to the pandemic. Ironton Lawrence County?s vOSV was tentatively rescheduled for June 2- 4, 2021 (as reflected in the ONHS-NMD site visit plan). SV-008549 however remains in my task queue.

"For grant T16MC06956, Task Number DG00004902, a notice of award (NoA) was released on 6/1/21 extending this award without funds (Type 4) until 5/31/2022. 

 

Due to the delay in release of this NoA, the project period end performance report (PPER), task number DG00004902, was released in EHB.

 

As supportive information to this request:

A.     The following 3 grants (in addition to T16MC06956) were extended for 12 months until 5/31/22: T16MC06955, T16MC29831, and T16MC06953.

B.      The following grant was extended for 6 months until 11/30/21: T16MC29833

 

To further supplement email below, previously and as per our expectation, the usual process has been to:

1.       extend the reporting period through to the end of the extension; and

2.       have grantee report performance data, for the last year and through to the extension end date, through a PPER.

 

If this usual process were followed, there would not be an NCC generated and:

A.     For the following 4 grants: T16MC06955, T16MC29831, T16MC06953, and T16MC06956, a PPER covering the reporting period between 6/1/20-5/31/22 would be generated after 6/1/22.

B.      For the following 1 grant: T16MC29833, a PPER covering the reporting period between 6/1/20-11/30/21 would be generated after 12/1/21.

o   NOTE: If an NCC were generated from 6/1/20-5/31/21 as proposed; then a PPER from 6/1/21-11/30/21 would produce incongruent data in this instance.

 

Therefore, this request is for Tier 2 or 3 to:

1.       Administratively close PPER (DG00004902) for grant T16MC06956

2.       Confirm status of performance reports to be created for the five T16 (Type 4) grants on extensions above.

3.       Confirm periods of performance to be covered within performance reports for the five T16 (Type 4) grants on extensions above.

""Hi Hanad,

Thank you for the feedback. I spoke with the recipient regarding this item. The recipient is unable to request an extension. I believe this is because the deadline for this submission was established as a ""hard"" deadline due to HRSA/HAB policy.

Is it possible for you to override this in EHB and allow the recipient to request an extension in order to resubmit? Please advise. Thank you.

I would like the new deadline to be 24-48 hours after the portal is made available.

Hello Jasmine,
I was looking back through my emails and noticed Juana Rodriguez is no longer the contact for Youngstown State University Nurse Corps Scholarship Program.
In the past, our office would send an invoice (see attached) to Juana's inbox and she would respond with a net amount (after taxes) to be awarded to the student(s).
Please let me know if you are aware of this process... Or if the process has changed, are you able to advise the next step necessary to determine the scholarship funds.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Many thanks!

"Hi IT team, 

We received additional funding for the U1C program in the recent FY21 Consolidated Appropriations act. Based on that funding increase, we need to extend the period of performance for the 8th research center, U1CRH20419. As you can see in the attached screen print, I was able to add this grant to the NCC but the default project period still ends 8/31/21. 

Do we need to change the project period now? Can we proceed with the NCC and change the project period for this recipient when we issue the NCC funding memo? The project period for U1CRH20419 will be extended until 8/31/2024. Either changing it now or changing it later is fine, I want to check with Tier 2 about the best way to implement the change. 

Thank you for your help.
