Issue #2:
Grantee Username: sollee@poison.ufl.edu
I am attempting to do the NCCPR based on the amount allotted in 2021. However, that is not what is coming up in the budget section.  It therefore wont? let me put in the correct budget. Allotment for 2021 was 460,759?.but what is populated is 433,373 and it won?t let me change it.

Issue #3:

I cannot update the amount in the EHB in order to put in my budget.

When I click on budget details in the EHB and go to Section A I see the amount of $435,236.

Detailed description of the Issue

The recipient for County of Dallas cannot start their Part A CARES Act Recipient Report (H9AHA36927) due to 3 of their providers already being in ?Submitted? status. Note that the larger issue here is that the 3 providers were able to submit their reports without all of their recipients being in ?Certified? status. This is a system error that is allowing them to do so.

Two asks:

Could you please move the H9AHA36927 Recipient Report into ?Working? status.

I am trying to finish the Ocracoke Health Centers? OSV conduct module (SV-008956). When I try add conditions, I am having an issue. I go into add key finding, fill out the information on the front page, including selecting the key finding (in this instance Required and Additional Services, but I do have several more that need to be placed), and selecting ?condition? at the bottom of the page. Then I select save and continue. It brings me to the page where I can usually select the condition I want to be placed, however when I select the drop down to choose a condition, it has 100 or more conditions listed from all requirements at all levels of progressive action). And, looking through the list, it does not seem to have the one I need. Usually it only lists the conditions associated with the requirements in their initial phases (90 days). This module has to be done, and the report has to be sent to the grantee, by tomorrow. Please help.

This issue is with the system, not with a particular condition. When I select the key finding, the drop down to place the condition should only list the conditions related to the key finding and they should only be in the initial phase (90). I have to place several conditions, and they each need separate entries with the information about why they are being placed. The conditions are:

1-Required and Additional Health Services-90-a. Providing and Documenting Services within Scope of Project
2-Clinical Staffing-90-f. Credentialing and Privileging of Contracted or Referral Providers

Good Evening Charleta and Dewitt,

It was good speaking with you today. As discussed, the following two 90 conditions were applied to the health center's H80 grant, due to the findings from the vOSV, which occurred 1/27/2021 - 1/29/2021:


1.       Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation-c. Accurate Documentation of Sites within Scope of Project: Within 90 days, provide documentation that the health center has corrected its scope of project and that all service sites within the HRSA-approved scope of project are now accurately recorded in HRSA's Electronic Handbooks (EHB) on the health center's Form 5B: Service Sites. Please see Chapter 6: Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation of the Health Center Program Compliance Manual(https://www.bphc.hrsa.gov/programrequirements/compliancemanual/index.html<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.bphc.hrsa.gov%2fprogramrequirements%2fcompliancemanual%2findex.html&c=E,1,HBCO8-d9bKwvkiSfEE50TIFVSJrMymDImB7wWp5Y9ZhzxlyUWvVCi6jWSvVxJFqjO9hqo-pa_HSTR-wZoH_FH1CEPifZvN6XUZvG2TZpcMf5a1Q34RE,&typo=1&ancr_add=1>) for additional information and contact your project officer with any questions. (45 CFR 75.207(a) and 45 CFR 75.371)

*         Form 5B is not an accurate reflection of all active sites in scope. Primary One Health, located at 1251 Bryden Rd., Columbus, OH 43205 (Site ID: BPS-H80-027456), is not a service delivery site as defined by HRSA and should not be included on Form 5B. HRSA reviewed documentation via a Correspondence Request and compliance for this element was not demonstrated.

2.       Required and Additional Health Services-a. Providing and Documenting Services within Scope of Project: Within 90 days, provide documentation that the health center is providing access to all required health services and that required and any additional service(s) are accurately recorded on Form 5A: Services Provided. If the health center is not currently providing access to the service(s) OR the change(s) in scope required to correct Form 5A is not yet approved and verified, provide an action plan detailing the steps the health center will take to implement the provision of all required services and/or correct Form 5A. Acceptance of this plan by HRSA will result in a condition, which provides 120 days for the health center to submit documentation that it is providing access to the required service(s) and/or has corrected its Form 5A. Please see Chapter 4: Required and Additional Health Services of the Health Center Program Compliance Manual (https://www.bphc.hrsa.gov/programrequirements/compliancemanual/index.html<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.bphc.hrsa.gov%2fprogramrequirements%2fcompliancemanual%2findex.html&c=E,1,WYjvxQGIlMe3TroVxNIj34JXks1Or7zgSSxyzj_nSpA0qXGwmQ6Z9VPkzFourvD-litM4eSQ1JNI_f11q1FoZGDnNjMRoc-DVVqbhMZXZk522rF4qI8z&typo=1&ancr_add=1>) for additional information and contact your project officer with any questions, including the applicable component(s) requiring corrective action. (45 CFR 75.207(a) and 45 CFR 75.371)

*         Remove from Column III: Well Child Services - All well child services are provided directly, and no formal referral agreement is required or exists. Additional Services: Remove from Column I: Recuperative Care Services - at the time of the VOSV, the center was not providing recuperative care services. As a result, this requirement was found to be out of compliance. HRSA reviewed documentation via a Correspondence Request and compliance for this element was not demonstrated.
Both condition responses are due in the EHB, by 07/05/2021 (90 days from the attached NOA date of issuance). As we discussed, you are strongly encouraged to submit the necessary documentation in the EHB to initiate the removal of the 90-day program conditions as soon as possible, but no later than the 90 day deadline.
In regards to Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation-c. Accurate Documentation of Sites within Scope of Project, I advised the health center to move forward with submitting a condition response in the EHB as soon as possible, since the health center already received notice (via NOA) that the site located at 1251 Bryden Rd., Columbus, OH, was removed from its scope of project (form B).
As discussed, the health center will need to provide documentation when responding to the condition in the EHB, indicating that the health center has corrected its scope of project and that all service sites within the HRSA-approved scope of project are now accurately recorded in HRSA's Electronic Handbooks (EHB) on the health center's Form 5B: Service Sites.
You can demonstrate compliance by submitting a letter, denoting that the health center has corrected its scope of project and that all service sites within the HRSA-Approved scope of project are now accurately recorded on the health center's form 5B (if this is the case), along w/ a copy of the NOA denoting that the site located at Bryden Rd. was removed from the health center's scope of project.
In regards to the condition:  Required and Additional Health Services-a. Providing and Documenting Services within Scope of Project, the health center submitted a CIS to remove recuperative care from column I, since recuperative care services are not currently provided directly. Note that the CIS request will soon be processed.
Once recuperative care is deleted from the health center's scope of project (form 5A), PrimaryOne Health can demonstrate compliance, by responding with a signed letter stating that the health center is providing access to all required health services and that required and any additional service(s) are accurately recorded on Form 5A: Services Provided, (if this is the case). Include w/ the submission, the NOA denoting that recuperative care was deleted from the health center's scope of project (once you receive the NOA). *The signed letter should also address well child services. Specifically, the health center should provide information about the current well child services --service delivery method and provide the formal referral agreement(s), if you disagree w/ deleting column III for this service (from the health center's form 5A).
Lastly, please note that the Health Center Program Support line (877-464-4772) has requested that you reach out to them directly to request technical assistance regarding locating the condition tasks in the EHB.
Please reach out to me if you have any questions regarding this email.

"Re: Please Help With Student Loan Relief

My name is Jenn.  I am currently disabled, thereby not currently employed in my field.  I have a Masters in Counseling and hold my LPCC license.  I have over 75k in student loan debt. 

I worked for a private agency in Middletown Ohio from 2012 until 2019. I worked out of the office, public schools and juvenile detention center. I provided mental health and substance use disorder treatment. 

My title before I became disabled was Director of Adolescent Addiction Services. 

I am struggling financially and already have an IDR repayment plan, but my mental health could really use this debt getting off of my plate. 

If you know of any resources, please, help me.

Thank you.

"I am trying to create an EHB account with the username khorst@csuchico.edu but am getting prompted that the username is already in use. However, when I use the ""Check if I have an account"" feature it states that this username does not have an account associated with it. 

Any assistance would be much appreciated!

Can we have DMI investigate and advise on the below from Vera?

In further reviewing these NoAs, the batching process also caused the funding in Box 33. Future Recommended Support ? Year 4 to be changed to $0.  All six of these grantees received a Type 4 extension that was batched by you and the contractor had to add the future funding period and dollar amount on the back end.

 I just had started to make corrections on these awards and now want to determine if the contractor wants to do the corrections so they can better analyze the problem.  The only item I have touched so far is the legislative authority citation on the Kagman award.

Both of these issues- the recommended future support and the legislative citation associated with batching must be corrected before we do the batching for the balance of funds actions for the H80  January and February start awards.   

Here is an example:

This is the last NoA for H80/31624-  Kagman Community Health Center ? note the amount in Box 33:  Screenshot attached

This is the current NoA in my queue with $0 in Box 33: Screenshot Attached"

"Hello Tier 2,

We have received 2 TA request from the Multnomah County Part A because users at their organization are having difficulties in accessing the RSR. Both users are registered to the organization Multnomah County Health Department Mental Health and Addictions Services Division (reg code: 34989). They have submitted RSRs in previous years but neither user can access their report this time. I confirmed they are using the correct Service Provider link, and they are receiving an error that their username/password are not correct. The usernames are:
Jose Garcia: His email address is jose.l.garcia@multco.us but his username appears to be clipped off (jose.l.garcia@multco). I'm not sure exactly what happened, but neither his full email address nor the shortened version work.
Laura Paz: username/email address are both laura.paz@multco.us. 
We've tried having Jose re-register with his full email address, but the system recognizes that he has an existing log in. We have not been able to figure out a work around. Can you resolve? The person who is helping these users and who referred to us is Lisa Alfano with the Multnomah Part A (lisa.alfano@multo.us). Please let us know if we can be of any assistance. Thanks,"
