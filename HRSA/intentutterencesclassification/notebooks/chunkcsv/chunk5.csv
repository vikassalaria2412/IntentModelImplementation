I have made several attempts to get my account verified.

This form asks for context and gives me a list of options...that make no sense to me because I don't have access to an account I created!

Can you provide the SQL query linking grant number and DUNS number that was used to populate the HDW file? Again, habwebdata_prod_rsrredesign.hab_org is not the correct source, since it contains incomplete DUNS information. 

I looked myself and was unable to find a complete source. 

Also, we need a complete source for TaxPayerID. habwebdata_prod_rsrredesign.hab_org does not have a complete listing, and we're looking for a source where the data is not self-reported by the organization. 

Please set this priority to high. The Deputy Administrator of HAB is requesting the complete TaxPayerID data.

"I am a Family Physician at Mee Memorial Healthcare System in King City California which operates a critical access hospital.  As a clinical practitioner, I have little knowledge about grant processes, so I am asking for advice.  In May, 2020, our hospital closed it's labor and deliver unit due to financial strains placed on the institution by the COVID 19 pandemic.  This caused our underserved,  and largely low income Latinx population to have to drive about one hour a hospital in to Salinas, California to receive labor and delivery services or even basic evaluation such as non-stress tests.  Our population often lacks adequate transportation for this journey, and it is just not medically safe for women, who may be bleeding or contracting, to have to travel that distance.  Other physicians and I have spoken to Hospital Administration about reopening the local labor and delivery unit, but we are told that there are financial constraints, including the costs of hiring and staffing with nurses and providing obstetrical coverage with either obstetricians or well-trained Family Practitioners.  We, the physicians, need assistance in navigating this process to see what funds might be available to reopen these services for our needy patient population."

"I recently served as BPHC Representative for a virtual Operational Site Visit at HPM Foundation, Inc. (H80CS00695). Only one non-compliant finding resulted from the OSV, and that finding was later found compliant through the Structured TA Report (STAR) Correspondence Request (CRO) process. There should be no non-compliant findings in the final STAR and no conditions should result from this OSV. When I went into the TATS TA Report module in EHB to download the final PDF version of the approved STAR (TA007079), the one finding still shows as non-compliant (see element b under Sliding Fee Discounts). My leadership requested that HCPS re-open the final STAR to correct this error so that there are no non-compliant findings in it. We also need a new final PDF version of the STAR created so that we can send the final STAR to the health center and close the Site Visit conduct module in EHB. We are supposed to send the final report to the health center within 45 days of the OSV that took place April 27-29 and we are fast approaching that date.

"Hi, Tier 2,

Please see the request below.

They reached the confirmation page (with the green banner), but did not receive an email confirmation and the extension request is not reflecting in EHB.

"Hi Marean!

I heard you?re the person to ask about an EHB RFI question! Some of my recipients requested the Core Medical Services waiver request be initiated in EHB, but decided they did not need to submit after all. Is there a way to have the report removed from their Task List? Mae said you?ve deleted a RFI before. Any help you can provide is appreciated! If it?s easier to have a call please let me know.

Thanks,
Kristin"
