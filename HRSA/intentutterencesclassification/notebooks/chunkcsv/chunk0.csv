"Good afternoon!

My name is Jasmin Fosheim. I'm an economic developer and grant writer in Hettinger, North Dakota.
 

I'm reaching out because I'm working with a small business here in Hettinger who provides in-home physical therapy to a large region within and beyond Hettinger. This service has been vital to our community, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability of older clients to travel. They are running into financial hardship, however, because of the number of windshield hours required to reach their clients. Although they can get comp-ed for mileage, their windshield time is not billable.
 

That said, they are looking for any support there might be for this specific area in which they are spending too much time and money with little return. Is there any chance you know of any programs they might be eligible for or organizations that might be able to provide support for this business model?

Thanks in advance for your time. Take care, Jasmin."

However, when I try to run reports, the system tells me I am not logged into AMS and it puts me in a loop that I can't get out of.  I login to AMS, try again, and when I try to run a report it just keeps telling me I'm not logged into AMS even though I am.

Did you confirm the role modification in the test environment or in the live environment?

Hi Hashini and Dana ?



I hope you had a nice weekend! I am wondering if you are aware of any way to expedite an update to EHB role modifications.



We have a funding memo due at the end of this week and Ayanna did not have the PGA role to be able to initiate and complete the FM. I requested the role modification early on Friday and it said it can take 3-4 business days. Are you aware of any way to expedite the request? It?s a generic EHB role, so am hoping it doesn?t require a lot of extra approvals.



Here is a screenshot with the request tracking number ?

Thanks, Erica!  I called and spoke with Nikeya at the helpdesk.  She had to forward the case onto someone else, so they are still working on it.  She said I should hear back in the next couple of days.



In case you need it for reference,  a new case number was assigned, 01073243.



Thanks,

Rachel

Thanks for checking on this!  The problem is that these are both coming back as an error, saying they are required fields.  I believe last time this delayed our submission because we were not able to submit the report with errors, so I just wanted to try preventing it from happening again.

Hi Rachel,



Thank you for keeping me in the loop.

I checked with our system developers on your issue and this is okay.

The fields are greyed out because they cannot be overwritten.



Take care,

Hi Erica,

I hope you are doing well!  Dr. Admon has begun working on her final report for grant R40MC32882, which is due 1/29/21.  However, we are having some of the same issues that we did in a previous report.  In Form 6, there is nothing filled in for the Aim and it is grayed out.  Also, there is the same problem with the Objective on Core 1, Tier 2.  I believe both of these should be auto populated.  Can you please assist with this?



Thanks,

Rachel

Hi Hashini and Dana ?



I hope you had a nice weekend! I am wondering if you are aware of any way to expedite an update to EHB role modifications.



We have a funding memo due at the end of this week and Ayanna did not have the PGA role to be able to initiate and complete the FM. I requested the role modification early on Friday and it said it can take 3-4 business days. Are you aware of any way to expedite the request? It?s a generic EHB role, so am hoping it doesn?t require a lot of extra approvals.



Here is a screenshot with the request tracking number ?

Subject: Expedite EHB Role Modification Approval?



Hi Hashini and Dana ?



I hope you had a nice weekend! I am wondering if you are aware of any way to expedite an update to EHB role modifications.



We have a funding memo due at the end of this week and Ayanna did not have the PGA role to be able to initiate and complete the FM. I requested the role modification early on Friday and it said it can take 3-4 business days. Are you aware of any way to expedite the request? It?s a generic EHB role, so am hoping it doesn?t require a lot of extra approvals.



Here is a screenshot with the request tracking number ?

"I believe REI has shared the DGIS Release 1 requirements with you where it was noted that CB 7 should be removed as an option to allow ?assignment?, since CB 7 is a retired form and should not be assigned to any MCHB program going forward.

Therefore, this request is to remove CB 7 from all existing DGIS Form Assignments.  Note: As you all work on this request, it may be helpful if you could run a query to determine if there are any remaining activity codes with CB 7 assigned. I am sure you all remember my previous request for H18 where CB 7 has already been removed.

Please remove CB 7 from the following activity codes: H61, U22, U40, UG8.  CB 7 should not be included in any future DGIS performance Reports.

NOTE: These changes must occur before the next set of performance reports are created for these activity codes.  Note:  I believe H61 grants will be first since they have a BPSD of 4/1. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Description: I?m reaching out to see if you can help with the below. Any assistance or insight is appreciated.

Tennessee Department of Health submitted a change in Principal Investigator (PI) back in December (see attached) and a  NOA issuing the change in PI was issued. However, the latest NOA that was just issued last week is still going to the previous director.  How can we get this corrected? The information is not getting to the recipient in a timely manner because of this. Please advise.

Action Taken: Verified in the Production that the PA Request for Change of PD was submitted by Joshua Rosenfeld on 12/03/2021. The request was later approved by GMS Marie Mehaffey. 

New NOA was issued on 03/16/2022. However, the NOA does not display Phadre Johnson as the new PD. New NOA continues to display the old PD Josh Rosenfeld."

Case Number: 01321538

Requester's Name: Jennifer Jue

Subject: HAB / High / 01321538 / Support request - Prior approval rebudgeting & SF-424A access

Additional POC:

Description:

My Part D recipient needs to submit a prior approval request in EHB. They need to request approval to modify their budget, and have chosen the rebudgeting request type which I believe is the correct request type. When the form populates, only one SF-424 loads, the R&R one. They need to complete a SF-424A, not an R&R. There is no option to select the SF-424A. What is going on?




?Please do not change the subject line.

If the subject line is changed, the agent will not receive your email.?
