80,Data Request,"My question pertains to the H8F application module and whether it's possible to get a list of the grantees that are requesting minor A/R.  

My understanding is that REI had to write a script in order to attach the TAR reviews for those grantees who selected to use funding for minor A/R.  This script may be triggered by the grantee reporting dollar amounts in the construction line in the SF-424.
Is it possible for OPPD to get a list of the grantee names, states, and H8F application numbers for those grantee that are requested minor A/R funding?  Those submissions undergo a separate program review by the Capital Oversight Team, so they are handled differently in the submission review processes.  I understand that these submissions are coming in gradually (they are due on May 31st). It may not be possible to get this report until all the submissions are in, but this list would help our review processes.  

If I can get this information through an existing report, please let me know.
Thanks!  Amy"

I know that we would need to ensure our FORM 5A is corrected to indicate that pharmacy services are provided directly but do we not add it as a service site? I know that a pharmacy does not meet the definition of a service site (by HRSA definition) but should we list it as an administrative site or something?

Obviously he needs privileges there and actually has them from his other practice, but he cannot currently see our patients there because that hospital is not currently in our scope.  We would like to bring it in scope.  

Our question is this:  can we add that hospital to our scope even though it is not in our service area?   If so, is it a matter of just adding it to our Form 5C?

I am a Project Manager for a software vendor in the lab industry.

So, we are reaching out in hopes that you can point us toward the vendors/products being utiltized to get such valuable data so that we can help our users improve the value of data they receive and bill insurance, not HRSA for a higher volume of patients on the first claim. 

Your assistance is incredibly important and most appreciated as we all strive to improve on every step of the way!

Thank you again for assisting me with the temporary to permanent site request. Please see below my original email. Our grant number is H80CS00178 and the specific temporary location is the True Health Infusion Center located at 4240 N Hwy 17-92, Sanford, FL 32773. Services originally began on 4/5/2021 and we requested a 90-day extension on 6/11/2021. With the delta variant, we have seen a huge increase in the number of patients seen and our local county partner has been gracious to work with us as we expand services to facilitate with the response effort. I do have board approval to proceed.

I tried logging into the EHB and completing a formal change in scope; however, I was unable to because the address was recognized in the system as a location. Today, I spoke with the someone at the EHB help desk and the representative explained that my project officer had to delete our temporary site so that I can enter the formal CIS. She asked me to reach back out for assistance with this. She was unable to confirm if the temporary site was deleted if it would impact our ability to provide services from this location until the formal CIS is completed. She said that is program related and should be answered by my PO.

Subject: Your Health Center?s Plans for Pediatric Vaccinations.

Hello, I am responding on behalf of our Project Director, Meredith Vaughan, who is on PTO.

Neighborcare Health, Seattle WA Grant No. H80CS00829


Neighborcare Health is not currently planning to host any Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccine Clinics.

We will be incorporating Pediatric COVID-19 vaccinations into our regular clinic flow both at our larger clinics and at our 15 school-based service sites located throughout Seattle and on Vashon Island.

Please let us know if additional info is needed.
Thank you
-Kara

Can that original request with the link be sent again to ahouston@fhsid.org? He is our CEO. None of the subsequent bulletins contain the link. Thank you!

? Hello,

As mentioned in our bulletin last week<https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USHHSHRSA/bulletins/2f78310>, we would like to get a better understanding of health center plans for vaccinating children under 12 years old once a pediatric vaccine is authorized.

We?d like a single representative for your health center (regardless of the number of sites) to share whether or not your health center plans to conduct pediatric vaccine clinics in partnership with schools and/or school-based health centers pending CDC and FDA approval of pediatric vaccines. Refer to question 12 in the Health Center COVID-19 Survey User Guide<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-data-collection-survey-tool-user-guide#12> for definitions of vaccine clinics.

Please submit your answer to the Health Center Pediatric COVID-19 Vaccination Plan<https://hrsa.force.com/HRSABPHC/s/hc-pediatric-covid-19-vaccination-plans> by 11:59 p.m. your local time on Friday, October 22.

Based on your response, you?ll receive a follow-up question:

  *   If Yes (you are planning clinics), we will ask how many vaccine clinics you anticipate conducting from the date pediatric COVID-19 vaccines are authorized by the FDA and CDC through the end of the calendar year.
  *   If No (you are NOT planning clinics), we will ask if there is any additional information or support HRSA can provide to help your health center conduct pediatric vaccine clinics.

This information will help us understand how best to support you over the next few months.

If you have questions about the Health Center Program and COVID-19, please contact Health Center Program Support online<http://www.hrsa.gov/about/contact/bphc.aspx>. Select ?Coronavirus Inquiries (COVID-19)? as the issue type?the third option on the ?Health Center or EHBs Question? screen.

You can also call Health Center Program Support at 877-464-4772, option 2, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET, Monday-Friday (except federal holidays).

As mentioned in our bulletin last week<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTEwMTguNDc1NDAxOTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2NvbnRlbnQuZ292ZGVsaXZlcnkuY29tL2FjY291bnRzL1VTSEhTSFJTQS9idWxsZXRpbnMvMmY3ODMxMCJ9.ggvw9nkngTZx4-9BroOvh8abw1hTnnHQCXPJR10cxIA%2Fs%2F492493387%2Fbr%2F114195286151-l__%3B!!IZ3lH8c!hB12qWAIvCXZ7c6DSkBAm6GsxzspvjTuDo5-Jzb2pQJJGpHpbGcBgnwi2mgMMqQ%24&data=04%7C01%7Cmgaytan%40aliviomedicalcenter.org%7C31e3ecd582f4466e4e2c08d9934610b8%7C637588ee272b4aa397cb23b8070aae59%7C0%7C0%7C637702751408584381%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=maAIdhArg9TGi0QfbWkt5VvjSMiL7kCGl0p4F%2Be2pU8%3D&reserved=0>, we would like to get a better understanding of health center plans for vaccinating children under 12 years old once a pediatric vaccine is authorized.
We?ve sent an email to the Project Director identified in HRSA?s Electronic Handbooks for your health center. This email came from BPHCAnswers@hrsa.gov<mailto:BPHCAnswers@hrsa.gov> and has subject line, ?Your Health Center?s Plans for Pediatric Vaccinations.?
We?d like a single representative for your health center (regardless of the number of sites) to share whether or not your health center plans to conduct pediatric vaccine clinics in partnership with schools and/or school-based health centers pending CDC and FDA approval of pediatric vaccines . Refer to question 12 in the Health Center COVID-19 Survey User Guide<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTEwMTguNDc1NDAxOTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2JwaGMuaHJzYS5nb3YvZW1lcmdlbmN5LXJlc3BvbnNlL2NvdmlkLTE5LWRhdGEtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1zdXJ2ZXktdG9vbC11c2VyLWd1aWRlIzEyIn0.1Px_vJXLj9lO7McMT9S-Dv9VR0SBkH2Aaf25vaHk9rk%2Fs%2F492493387%2Fbr%2F114195286151-l__%3B!!IZ3lH8c!hB12qWAIvCXZ7c6DSkBAm6GsxzspvjTuDo5-Jzb2pQJJGpHpbGcBgnwilIynCEw%24&data=04%7C01%7Cmgaytan%40aliviomedicalcenter.org%7C31e3ecd582f4466e4e2c08d9934610b8%7C637588ee272b4aa397cb23b8070aae59%7C0%7C0%7C637702751408594329%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=0XjnM69foRtktKK1lcmDoo2StFMcqXnHGFtxWmm%2F%2Fp8%3D&reserved=0> for definitions of vaccine clinics.
Please share your answer by 11:59 p.m. your local time on Friday, October 22.
Based on your response, you?ll receive a follow-up question:

  *   If Yes (you are planning clinics), we will ask how many vaccine clinics you anticipate conducting from the date pediatric COVID-19 vaccines are authorized by the FDA and CDC through the end of the calendar year.
  *   If No (you are NOT planning clinics), we will ask if there is any additional information or support HRSA can provide to help your health center conduct pediatric vaccine clinics.
This information will help us understand how best to support you over the next few months.
If you have questions about the Health Center Program and COVID-19, please contact Health Center Program Support online<https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.com%2Fv3%2F__https%3A%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMTEwMTguNDc1NDAxOTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3Lmhyc2EuZ292L2Fib3V0L2NvbnRhY3QvYnBoYy5hc3B4In0.6uyKT8JCQYEK5AQRiKPxGB5oJHn-0htUH9_hYyhMICo%2Fs%2F492493387%2Fbr%2F114195286151-l__%3B!!IZ3lH8c!hB12qWAIvCXZ7c6DSkBAm6GsxzspvjTuDo5-Jzb2pQJJGpHpbGcBgnwiBz8-P_k%24&data=04%7C01%7Cmgaytan%40aliviomedicalcenter.org%7C31e3ecd582f4466e4e2c08d9934610b8%7C637588ee272b4aa397cb23b8070aae59%7C0%7C0%7C637702751408604285%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=zR3gus4Ez4hmySqvkbZItOWZN6mEjg7FX8lRJ7yn7cI%3D&reserved=0>.

487,System Enhancement,"I have submitted a request to increase the character limit for some of the comment boxes in the alert list due to reaching the limit and being unable to continue to make updates.  Below is the last communication I had with Krishna Singh on my request:

 

·         The latest update we have as of now is currently team is working on the analysis and we would be working with BPHC bureau to request approval for the enhancement. We will update on the timeline of the fix after the discussion with OIT and BPHC bureau.

 

In order to maintain providing updates on the health center grant listed above, I am suggesting that I recommend the alert entry issue as resolved, and then create a new/continuation alert list entry for the same category.  Will this be acceptable and if not, please advise on other options.  Thank you!"
488,System Enhancement,"When a grantee submits an extension for a submission (namely the most recent Covid and Capital awards H8F's/C8E's), there is no way for another PO, PQC, POA to move the Extension task to another individual.  In fact, when you go to Activities, Tasks for the person, it does not even show that there is an Extension submission.  Thus Programs may not even be aware there is an extension request unless the HC reached out to BPHC asking why it hadn't been accepted/denied yet.    This Hidden task could be related to how it is coded as ""General"".   Would like to know if the role is causing this task to be hidden from others as well  request an enhancement to have this task show up in ""seeable"" task by others and that the task can be moved by any EHB Program role.  Please refer to tickets: Service request update for Case # 01305908 (Grant/LAL#)    [ ref:_00Di0bMPM._500t0w9d9n:ref ],  Service request update for Case # 01305908 (Grant/LAL#)    [ ref:_00Di0bMPM._500t0w9d9n:ref ].   It appears that the only way to move this task is to ask the developers to move it to the correct queue.  This causes work stoppage for Programs to complete their tasks, work stoppage for the HC because they cannot open the task until Program takes action as well as a bit of embarrassment that we don't know what was submitted by our grantees.  Please reach out if you have any questions.  Thank you!!"

492,System Enhancement,"BPHC has a need to validate financial data submitted as part of UDS Table 9E against the OFAM Data Mart and potentially other sources within EHBs (e.g., UDS Table 5 and GAAM Form 5). This is because BPHC has detected discrepancies between these financial data sources. The purpose of this enhancement would be twofold: (1) to ease the UDS submission process by pre-populating data already existing in other modules of EHBs and/or data marts into UDS Table 9E; and (2) to create a validation mechanism to flag data inconsistencies (should the pre-populated data be changed or should a discrepancy arise after submission) and allow for correction or further investigation."
493,System Enhancement,"At present, physical address and location data in BHCMIS and service delivery files are not standardized and do not included geocoding data. To ease the process of creating maps, BPHC has a need for all physical addresses in BHCMIS and data marts to utilize a standard format and to be geocoded ? i.e., for coordinates to be added to the database for each address value. Invalid addresses or those that cannot be geocoded should be flagged for follow-up and appropriate reports created to identify addresses requiring follow-up. HDW offers an address validation and geocoding feature that can be utilized for this purpose, likely via API call, if needed."
494,System Issue,"When completing a GAAM application (i.e. a grant application) in EHBs/BHCMIS , the left menu repeatedly auto-collapses as one progresses through the various application pages, even if the applicant manually (re-) expands it.

Subject: H8F awards in EHB queue
 
Two issues with the H8F awards that were issued to health centers yesterday.

 

I received all of the NOAs yesterday, but did not see the grants in my queue, i.e., in the EHB under Program Oversight, the My Grants tab.  I eventually clicked on the Other Grants tab and filtered for H8F and see the H8F awards are there.  (See attached.)  The problem is there are two or three duplicate folders for the same grant for most of mine. 

 

·         How can I get rid of the duplicate folders?

·         How can I move the H8F awards TO My Grants tab from the Other Grants tab.  (Other grants are typically the old expired capital grants, etc...)

The Applicant (Creek Valley Health Clinic - Health Center), only has one zip code in its HRSA-identified scope, which is 86021. The school is located in zip code 860201.

As you can see by the red arrow in the screenshot below - it looks like there are no allowable zip codes in the EHB for Creek Valley Health Clinic. Maybe the HRSA-identified scope has not been updated for Creek Valley Health Clinic? For your reference, Creek Valley Health Clinic is a new FQHC, as it received the FY2019 New Access Point Grant.

Please advise on how to proceed.

Thank you!"

Hi Anthony,
I didn't know it before today, but there is actually a report you can run to see extension requests-it's called ""Grant Deliverable Extensions"". When I run the report for Grand Prairie, I definitely see the two extension requests, but I can't see where they are-I'll paste a screen shot of one below so you can see what I mean. I think you'll have to submit a ticket with HCPS to try and find them.

Subject: Tracking tasks

Hey Michelle,

I need some help finding two tasks from my health center by searching their tracking #(which I admittedly don't know how to do). I am assuming this was split up when I deployed but I am having trouble tracking them down. The tracking numbers are below. Could you reassign them to me?

""Grand Prairie Services submitted an extension on two of our tasks for grant# L2CCS42325, tracking #297179 and 297180. Can you please approve the extension so we can complete this task?""

Thank you,

First, I have not been receiving emails about our C8E grant, and I think I figured out why. My user information shows my email address as kbedard@nohn-pa.org, but my POC information for our C8E grant shows my email address as kbedardl@nohn-pa.org. (There is an L at the end of my email address that should not be there.) If this something that can be fixed? Also, where is this incorrect email address coming from? I remember this being an issue previously and I thought it was fixed then but it?s still showing up so it must not be. But because my profile shows the correct email address, I don?t know where to fix it.

Additionally, when I try to use this contact form, my information keeps showing up as being based in Maryland, with no organization affiliation. I've changed it multiple times but it never seems to ""stick."" I work for North Olympic Healthcare Network in Washington (state). Is there a way to make sure this information is saved?

Due Date: 07/31/2024
This Notice of Award (NoA) reflects approval of a change in scope to the following:
Add Site:
Palmer Clinic
Site Address: 425 Dahlia St STE L & M, Palmer, Alaska, 99645-6463:
This change in scope is not yet effective; within 30 days from the end of the project period, you must submit an electronic deliverable verifying the proposed action consistent with the description provided within the application.
 
This condition is showing up under their terms and conditions in EHB for their C8E grant, but it's not showing up under their submissions.  The grantee would like to verify that the site is open and operational for 340B purposes, but it cannot do so because there is no site verification submission on which to take action.

Will you please review and let us know what may be happening?  In addition, is it possible that this issue is more wide-spread?  For instance, could this be an issue for other C8E awards?
 
Please note that the site verification conditions for C8E are different from those of NAP, which require site verification in 120 days. For C8E, award recipients have up to 30 days past the 30year performance period end date to verify that their site is open and operational.  Some grants may have active capital activities occurring at the site even while they are actively serving patients. In these situations, HRSA should allow sites to verify that their sites are open and operational in accordance with BPHC's requirements ""The health center should verify its site as operational in EHB once it is providing some level of care and seeing patients at the site.""

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organization. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and are confident the content is safe.


Hello,

The Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County (CCALAC) submitted Phase 1 of its Health Center Controlled Networks (HCCN) grant application (HRSA-22-009) via Grants.gov on Tuesday, January 25, 2022. Our Grants.gov application tracking number is GRANT13531096. As of today (January 28, 2022), I have not yet received notification from HRSA (the agency that received the Grants.gov application) that Phase 2 of our application is available in HRSA Electronic Handbooks (EHB). I then contacted HRSA EHB Health Center Program Support via telephone at (877) 464-4772. The ticket number for my inquiry is #01292980. The person I spoke with (Sunday A.) told me that they ran a report showing our Grants.gov Application Status in EHB and it says there's an ""Application Error"" with respect to our application. Sunday then advised me to contact the Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) Helpline to determine what our next steps should be.

I contacted the BPHC Helpline, and they said that, while they will follow up on the issue from the HRSA EHB side, they suggested that I contact the Grants.gov Contact Center to see if there is any information they can give me as to what the problem might be.  I am attaching the screenshot sent to me by Sunday A. showing our Grants.gov application status in HRSA EHB. Please advise as to the next steps, keeping in mind that our Grants.gov application deadline for HRSA-22-009 is February 1, 2022.

Thank you!

1080,System Issue,"HCCN Grant Application Announcement # HRSA-22-009.  The Program Specific Form/Project Work Plan does not allow you to enter the number 0 in the baseline numerator.  

I am trying to enter the information for the HRSA Objective 4 - Disaggregated patient-level UDS data. None of our health centers have submitted a UDS+ test file so the correct baseline numerator is 0. However, when you enter 0 in the baseline numerator field,  40 in the baseline denominator, and 20 in the target number of health center field, EHB automatically makes the target % 0 since it appears to use the baseline numerator instead of using the target field for the calculation. 

Once EHB changes the target percentage field to 0%, EHB gives an error in the Target Percentage field of ""provide a Target Percentage greater than 0"".

How can I enter the correct information into EHB? Is there a workaround that we should use such as entering 1 in the baseline numerator and adding a note in baseline data source?"
1081,System Issue,"Greetings -

I am currently the Project Officer for El Pueblo Health Services Inc. (LALCS00040). El Pueblo Health Services has been attempting to submit their renewal designation application for a May start date. They informed me ahead of their January deadline that there was a HRSA entered number on their Form 1A that was not allowing them to submit their application. The error message read ""The 'Current Number' of visits should be greater than or equal to the 'Current Number'  of Total Patients"".   They received guidance from BPHC Answers that the number was generated from their UDS report that was incorrect on the health center's end. The health center stated the number in form 1A taken from their UDS report only includes their in-person visits and doesn't include their virtual visits. According to the health center, the Form 1A shows patient visits as 4400 when it should be 14400 which was the number taken from their recertification last year. The health center firmly believes this was a system error from when the data was imported. I am unsure how to help the LAL but they have been attempting to submit this application and informed me in advance of the deadline of the issue and has kept me informed of each update from HCPS, OPPD and others. Any assistance in helping the LAL submit this application is greatly appreciated.

Thank You,"

Under SF-PPR Page 3 Project Data [ 44912-1: Future Home of Live Oak Community Health Center ].  1b. and  1c do not apply if you answered ""Yes"" in 1a (Have there been any changes to the project budget, project location, or scope of project?). Additionally, they are not available in the report to be answered on the reporting page but shows up on the ""Print All"" page.

SF-PPR Page 3a Project EVM Data [ 44912-1: Future Home of Live Oak Community Health Center ]. If you answered ""Yes"" in 1a, then 1b does not apply. It does not show up on the reporting page, but shows up in the ""Print All"". 

In section 2. Project Budget, if the answer is ""Over Budget"", then 2a and 2a explanation does not apply. They do not show up on the report page, but they show on the ""Print All"" page.

After entering the equipment list in the EHB (9 units @ $15,540 apiece), I am unable to proceed in EHB (screenshot attached) because this amount exceeds the allowed $60,000. What is the best solution? Should I purchase 3.86 units (which amounts to about $60,000) in order to meet the $60,000 opportunity?

Good Afternoon Eric,

 

I greatly need your assistance in guidance of changing the project director for our EHB.  I am currently serving as the Interim CEO for Covered Bridge.  I have a log in for the EHB but I do not have access to any of the grant information.  As you know, we are in the process of our CRO thus I need to be able to have access.

 

Dave (our CFO) is also attempting to apply for additional grant funding which is becoming a challenge due to the restriction in access. 

 

If you could please give me a call 269-233-4165 or email me I would greatly appreciate it.

Konza Prairie Community Health Center (Konza) currently has 2 SAC applications (HRSA-22-002) validated in the EHB.  This issue has been discussed, at length, with grants.gov and the EHB.  We are seeking guidance as to which application to submit as the final Service Area Competition proposal. Details about the submission circumstances and tracking numbers are below.  Referenced emails are attached.  Screenshots are included for your information.  Thank you in advance for your assistance, we apologize for the inconvenience this error, and revision, has caused. 
First Submission
?	Danielle Hallgren submitted the grants.gov application #GRANT13419408 on 7/9/2021 receiving a Submission Receipt email.  The UEI was JKNCXKKFEPH1 the assigned Agency Tracking Number was 196176, as indicated on the attached email.  The application was validated in the EHB.  Upon further review, it was found there was an error in the grants.gov application (field 9. Type of Applicant). 
 
?	After speaking with grants.gov, we were advised to submit a new application.  They stated it would override the first submission and the granting agency would select the last application submitted. 

Second Submission
?	Danielle Hallgren made the revision in the screenshot below and submitted the grants.gov application #GRANT13419586 on 7/9/2021 receiving the Submission Receipt and Agency Retrieval emails.  
 

On 7/13/21 Konza received a ?Duplicate application disallowed? email stating that Grant1319408 had been disallowed and deemed non-responsive due to the fact that we submitted an application with grants.gov tracking number GRAN13419586. 

Following that email, Konza received the attached GRANT1319586 Tracking Number Assignment email and subsequent ?Application GRANT13419586 Ready for Review and Corrections? email. The Grantor agency assigned the Agency Tracking Number 196228 to the application.  The application was validated in the EHB.  
Konza now has 2 applications validated in the EHB, the first submission 196176, stated disallowed, and the second, revised submission 196228.

Should Konza proceed with completing the application 196228 and submit per guidelines, or should we use the first application?  Is there a way to remove the disallowed application?"

Can someone please clarify/confirm this discrepancy for me; so, I know how often to report after next week?s first report?

Okay, I just received the email indicating you should be able to now place orders for COVID tests.  Orders must be placed today if we want to receive the test kits next week.  If you have problems placing the order, please let me know.   See details below in the email from HRSA, but also please do note the following:



We will receive the following test kit:

https://quickvueathome.com/<https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fquickvueathome.com%2F&data=04%7C01%7CKatie.Weinberg%40stjoe.org%7Cb50ff14684af4e432bb208d9c6848252%7C2e3190869a2646a3865f615bed576786%7C0%7C0%7C637759094716822432%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=td9302FTGkspOlbZG5N%2BRbbb%2BPBNV0z0Xrbid1u2PDc%3D&reserved=0>

  *   Quidel QuickVue At-Home OTC COVID-19 tests are rapid antigen test that can be self-administered for ages 14+. Adult-administer for individuals ages 2-13 years.

     *   Test effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases
     *   Results in 10 mins.



We have the option to order test kits in quantities of individual shippers (45 test kits per shipper). Quantities greater than 30 shippers will be packaged and shipped as a pallet.

  *   Each test kit contains two tests.
  *   Each shipper contains 45 test kits and weights 22.5 lbs. (19-3/4"" L x 15-1/4"" W x 9-1/2"" H)
  *   Each pallet contains 30 shippers (1,350 test kits) and weighs approximately 675 lbs.

We should store tests kits at room temperature (15 25?C/59-77?F), in a place away from direct sunlight

There are reporting requirements and there are patient education requirements/expectations.  I will discuss with Joy today and we will get back to you before the test kits arrive with more details on what data we need to capture as we distribute tests.





Thanks,

Tim

Submit Your Order by 11:59 pm local time on DECEMBER 21, 2021:

Submit your test order by 11:59 pm local time on Tuesday, December 21. If you meet this the first order cycle deadline, we anticipate that your order will be delivered before the end of the year. Tracking information will be shared confirming the exact delivery date.



The next order cycle deadlines are 11:59 p.m. your local time on Tuesday, December 28, and Tuesday, January 4, 2022. Additional order cycles will be announced by Tuesday, January 4, 2022, as health centers continue onboarding into the program on a rolling basis.



Health centers and rural health clinics have the option to order test kits in quantities of individual shippers (45 test kits per shipper). Quantities greater than 30 shippers will be packaged and shipped as a pallet. A shipping company representing Quidel will contact your health center?s POC to arrange a date and time for delivery for large orders (such as tractor trailer full, which is 26 pallets).

  *   Each test kit contains two tests.
  *   Each shipper contains 45 test kits and weighs 22.5 lbs. (19-3/4"" L x 15-1/4"" W x 9-1/2"" H).
  *   Each pallet contains 30 shippers (1,350 test kits) and weighs approximately 675 lbs. (48""L x 40"" W x 56"" H).



Health centers and Medicare-certified rural health clinics are encouraged to consider the amount necessary to meet ongoing community needs and their capacity to receive and store the tests when placing their orders.

I was not sure what the best way would be to contact BPHC, but we forgot to submit our report last week and was wondering if there was another way we can go about submitting our data.

2388,Training/User Error,"The Mt Vernon Neighborhood Health Center, Inc., MVNHC, Inc., is a Legacy FQHC operating in our community for close to 50 years. 
Seeking to establish a Doing Business As (DBA) under Westchester Community Health Center.  We inquired with New York State, and the next steps are as follows:
This option requires the administrative approval of NYSDOH, with no public review. The operator submits a proposed certificate of assumed name, covered by a brief letter that states why the name change is requested. The review typically takes 30-60 days. Even in a worst-case scenario, it would be hard to imagine not securing approval prior to October 2022. Once approved, the doing business as the name may be used on all signage, publications, websites, etc.
We seek guidance on how to proceed regarding HRSA, FQHC, and FTCA requirements for a (DBA).
Please note that MVNHC, Inc., will maintain its original corporate name/ identity (MVNHC, Inc) Tax#: 133315508.
We look forward to your feedback regarding this matter.

We have an issue with a Capital Update prior approval # PA-00105534; The ?Overall Program Specific Review Status? were fully completed in the request BUT the request was returned to the award recipient.  It has since been re-submitted BUT under the Program Specific Review Status, the status changed from ?Complete? to ?Not Started?  See below:

When we look at the ?Manage Program Specific Reviews? (see below), both reviews for 188145-01 are shown as completed and we can view the completed review BUT we cannot process the Capital Update and we cannot mark it as ? Not Applicable? because the system says they are In Progress.
 
One of the progress report is shown below (and it is complete at both levels):
 
We are concerned that this may be a system error that will impact all Capital Updates that are returned.  In order to provide service to the award recipient, we have processed this request but needed to attached pdf versions of the completed reports (this is less than ideal).

We believe that the system was adjusted so that the TAR reviews are not deleted by the system does not see to realize that this is the case.  Please review in the system to determine what type of correction will be needed to the Capital Update TAR review module."

2487,Training/User Error,"Hello, 
This is a ""prior approval"" question. Prior to reaching out --through this portal for help, I have reviewed the portfolio mgmt. SOP post monitoring, form 5B instructions (pg 10), contacted my TL, as well as contacted the BPHC helpline.  After receiving guidance in terms of how to proceed to make the change on form 5B, I conveyed details to the grantee POC. 
The issue is this---a grantee H80CS00626 needs to correct a long overdue error on form 5B where it reads: ?site operated by?.  The corrected text should state: subrecipient, NOT contractor.  The grantee has nearly 20 practice sites that requires this correction.  
The helpline, form 5B instructions and per the internal SOP  Portfolio Mgmt Routine Post-Award Monitoring SOP ? pages 14-16---reads that such a change requires a prior approval.  It appears that the type would be ?other ?other?.  This was confirmed by the helpdesk rep.  I was led to believe that one single prior approval would trigger the change for all form 5Bs within the grantee?s portfolio.  Today, 2 25 21 the grantee submitted the prior approval in EHB, and the GMS is stating that this is not accurate as the submission will not result in the desired change on form 5B.  Hence?the reason why I am reaching out to you.  Can you help me please?  What task is needed to make this correction?"

Good Evening,

I am trying to find where to complete the weekly COVID-19 vaccine survey and cannot locate it.  I understood that we were to go into the ordering portal and submit how many doses we had on hand which I completed on Monday.  Is it sent out to a specific individual weekly? Please advise where the survey is located so that it can be completed.

We are providing some services there even though we are planning to renovate under our OHI grant and fully relocating our Stratford site there.  Is there a way to fix this? We have to register our 340B sites and this site cannot show as pending.  Please advise.  This is one we had actually mentioned to you at our first meeting. We have an OHI (Oral Health Infrastructure) grant for our dental practice at that site and had to submit the CIS as part of the application. We have already moved some of our medical services there about 6 months ago.  We have an extension on our OHI grant so the work is not complete yet. I believe the OHI is why the ?pending? is showing in the EHB.   Should we verify it now so the pending status goes away? Or how will that affect our grant?"

2673,Training/User Error,"Several questions:
1. Definition of ""majority"" for service area purposes.  For example, if 75% of our patient population resides in 10 zip codes and UDS data indicates 25% (aggregate) patient origin dispersed through an additional 12 zip codes, would the HC be required to evaluate need and seek a service area adjustment to align with the UDS?
2.  Informal 5A Adjustments:  the guidance is clear with respect to formal CIS requests, but not Adjustments.  By ""PO Monitored"" does the Bureau mean request adjustment through our PO?
3. 6A Adjustments 9new officers, etc.) what is the process for 6A updates?
4. 5A III Referral Providers (endoscopy services, diagnostic radiology):  due to the small number of available providers in Santa Fe, we have encountered resistance (refusal to sign agreements, no return calls, etc.) to Referral Agreements containing Sliding Fee Discount terms. How does the Bureau recommend that we comply with SFD program requirements given that we cannot control or dictate terms to the limited number of  specialty providers in this area?

These questions are specifically about cases of significant re-budgeting and the need for prior approval for NoA #1 H8FCS41632-01-00, ARPA H8F. My understanding is that for award H8F, prior approval due to significant re-budgeting is not required unless re-budgeting of the approved budget exceeds 25% of the award amount. 
(1) Does this apply to both within and between object class categories? For example, will adjusting positions and salaries within the object class category of personnel count towards the 25%? 
(2) Our budget narrative breaks up year one and year two of the award. If funds remain in the same line item, but are carried over from year one to year two, does that contribute towards the 25%?"

We have a client who wants to add a site located at a middle school. There is a currently School-Based Health Center (SBHC) on the school campus, but they would like to add the actual school so counselors are not in a separate building. The SBHC is a small building on the middle school campus separated by a walkway but holds the same physical address as the middle school. This would result in two site locations having the same physical address. Is this allowable if they are technically two separate buildings housed on the same school campus?

If a patient is reported positive, does our health center have to follow-up with every individual via phone call? Does the patient report directly to the state by themselves  in addition to documenting it in the EHR?

In terms of reporting for the UDS at the end of the year, will our health center report the number of positives and patients?

Thank you in advance for any help you can provide.

Hello Kathy ? We have not be able to delete on our end. The GW SBHC was approved as a new scope of service and has been verified. However, a second CIS request was generated by mistake that we need to have deleted. It says if we do not approve in the next 6 days it will be deactivated. Please let me know if you can delete or if I should approve a 2nd time (realizing that we will then have 2 approved scopes for the same service site.

 

Thank you,

I was reviewing my organization's OPA recertification and I realized that we are missing a piece of an address for one of our sites.

Our Children's Care East site (BPS-H80-013952) is missing its condominium number. The address is listed as 6350 DAVIS BLVD, NAPLES, FL 34104, but should actually read 6350 DAVIS BLVD, #1001,  NAPLES, FL 34104.

I don't see an option to submit a change in the EHB how should we go about correcting this error? Thank you!

3649,Training/User Error,"My grandson was recently diagnosed with cancer.  He is undergoing cancer treatment at a local non-profit hospital.  He was diagnosed at 6 months and is a nursing baby.  His mother (my daughter) stays with him at the hospital for days and weeks at a time in a tiny room where only a simple chair is provided.  We have inquired about a chair that would make holding and nursing a baby easier, but the nurses tell her they don't have any such chairs available in the area she is in -- the Pediatric Cancer ward (total of 11 rooms).  She has recently started taking a semi-reclining camp chair from home to provide a little more comfort on their stays there.  I have spoken with some people who were interested in helping donate chairs that could better accommodate mothers and young children, but the hospital told us the only ""approved"" rocker/recliner type chairs cost just under $4,800 each!  Wow!  So now I'm wondering if there is any type of government grant money available to help with improvements that could better accommodate these families who are already experiencing such a horrible thing as childhood cancer?  I would be so grateful if you could provide me with any information on how I could help make an application for such a type of grant.

3690,Training/User Error,"Greetings, 

Unfortunately, I take responsibility for the misunderstanding of the hard deadline for the ARP submission by the PCAs. I misunderstood and thought as long as they had the progress report submitted by their due date, there would be time in this first week of March to return for any updates needed. I?ve heard from the below PCAs that they can?t return the ARP reports in EHB and it?s in ?view only? mode. I don?t want the PCAs to be unfairly penalized for having a late report when that?s not accurate.  I?m sincerely requesting if you all can open up the ARP submission for them to return their progress reports or if there?s a way to pull the reports back from return status, on the PCA end, and back into my review queue would be appreciated also. I could then just make the needed notations. I?ve spoken to and copied my team lead on this request for awareness.

 

I thank you in advance for your time and response to this matter. I greatly appreciate your assistance.

 

The PCAs are:

See question detail below:

THE EMAIL:
We had a deliverable (the implementation/certification document) in EHB for award C8E, project 2 (generator purchase).  Back in January, I had submitted for an extension to 9.1.2022 by attaching a document to the submission request.  Gianna Jackson, who was the former point of contact for this grant, responded with this email:

               
From: Gianna Jackson <gjackson@hrsa.gov> 
Sent: Friday, January 14, 2022 1:48 PM
To: Coggins, Constance <Constance.Coggins@healthreach.org>
Subject: Change Requested for Submission:(191464-02) Project Implementation Certification by HRSA

-- CAUTION: External Email ? This email originated outside of HealthReach. Please do not click any links or open any attachments unless you know the sender. 
A Change Request for following Submission has been requested by HRSA:

Submission Name : (191464-02) Project Implementation Certification
Submission Tracking Number: 00319916
Grant Number: C8ECS43828

Following Comments were added by the HRSA Reviewer for your information:
There should be an area in this submission where you can request an extension. However, I have changed the due date to 2/28/2022; if you need longer than that, you will need an official extension request. 



We have not yet engaged an engineer for this generator installation process so this time, I used the ?Smart Assist? feature in EHB to request an extension as Gianna requested.  Now, the submission is marked ?late? in EHB and there is no tracking function on the home page to understand where this extension is in the approval process.  It is disconcerting because I used the ?request an extension? feature on the due date so it shouldn?t be marked ?late? in EHB.

Can you please advise what I might expect from using this smart assist ?request an extension? function?  I asked for an extension to the originally requested date of 9.1.2022.  Next week, I?ll also be asking for an extension for some deliverables for our H8F award and what to be sure that these requests are being recognized and properly processed.

Thank you,

? Reason/justification for deadline extension request ? EHB Error

Please see below timeline of events:
 
? The grant was submitted on 3/1/2021 around 2:30 PM on the EHB. It is important to note that during this submission we faced several errors and had to redo the same steps numerous times and were finally successful in submitting the application.
? Post submission this grant disappeared from our Task List on the EHB.
? Additionally, I would also like to state that one of our team members, copied on this email Dr. Cyril Ubiem who has the same access as me on EHB was unable to make any changes to this grant and therefore, I had to do the submission and edits on EHB.
? I have the access of an Authorizing Official and have submitted several grants, inlcuidng UDS and scope change requests in the past.
? Later that day when we tried accessing the EHB the system would not work but we were convinced that we had successfully submitted the grant and were not troubled by the system error.
? On 3/4/2021 at 4:00:30 PM EST we received an email confirming the EHB glitches and giving applicants an extension, which we did not need again as we had submitted the grant. Please see below a snpahost of the aforementioned email:
 
? I continued my habit of checking the EHB on a weekly basis to be on top of tasks that are due on the EHB and this grant was never there post 3/1/2021.
? I was back on the EHB 3/8/2021 ? 3/16/2021 numerous times to complete the follow-up steps on our UDS submission and I did not see this grant anywhere on the EHB?s pending tasks or non-completed tasks.
? Today, I received a call from our CEO stating that this grant is now re-appearing as ?Pending? on our EHB?s task lists.
? When I logged-in on my EHB account I saw it as well, and when I clicked on the ?Edit? button it shows an error stating the deadline is past.
? When I go under Grant Applications tab and click on this grant; it now shows the application with the comment ?Submitted to Authorizing Official?
? We can still see all the information that was added to this grant on 3/1/2021 by us before submission.
? We immediately called the HRSA EHB line at 877-464-4772 and after a conversation with one of the support rep, we were asked to call 301-594-4300.
? We called 301-594-4300 multiple times and were only able to leave a message
 
We are escalating this incident to you in the hopes that you will be able to correct this error and support our successful submission of this application, which is vital to our health center and our community.
 
Thank you for your anticipated cooperation."

Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic.

President Donald J. Trump granted on March 28, 2020, a Major Disaster Declaration (4499DR-OR) for the State of Oregon, triggering the release of Federal funds to help communities recover from COVID-19. The incident period that the declaration covers initiated on January 20, 2020, and is continuing, in all 36 Oregon counties.
4. A brief statement on how the health center, the target population, and/or a medically underserved population have been impacted. (This should be no more than one to two sentences.)  

The coronavirus has significantly impacted the unhoused populations, those lacking adequate health care options due to poverty, the elderly, those uniquely at risk to infectious disease/respiratory illness, in addition to the general public.
 
5. A brief description of the emergency response activities. The request must include a summary of the requested change in scope of project, including:

White Bird has opened a vaccination clinic in order to scale up vaccinations and offer an accessible indoor space in downtown Eugene. 

Nurses, doctors, dentists, pharmacists and other medically-trained community members have volunteered to administer vaccines, and volunteer clerical staff keep the operation running smoothly. 

White Bird staff coordinate the effort. The CCPA is providing the facility below cost because its new board agreed unanimously that this was the best possible use of the facility during this time of crisis.
A month ago White Bird began vaccinating health care professionals. In support of Lane County Public Health, White Bird is now vaccinating all individuals who are eligible according to the CDC. 

EFFECTIVE DATE: Services were initiated March 8, 2021. 

The vaccination clinic will continue until all appropriate target populations are vaccinated. WB does not have a hard date for project termination.

Improve Healthcare Access

Separate, not mutually exclusive from, improving the fractured, fragmented healthcare payment system. If healthcare were free, or if it were entirely paid by the government, or by the world?s billionaires, it wouldn?t matter if the nearest hospital is miles away, and/or the nearest healthcare practitioner, from shaman through physician, couldn?t be reached even for a telemedicine consult because there?s no Internet or Wifi access.

Wild/crazy ideas, in no particular order:

The US has severe shortages of qualified people in every healthcare profession. Therefore,
Completely upend post high school curricula to emphasize the practical. Doesn?t matter whether the student?s goal is to become a CNA, LPN, RN, MD, doula/midwife, pharmacist, even psychologist or social worker, etc.
By the end of Year One - be a practicing Emergency Medical Technician (EMT). Model the studies after those given to military medics. Can?t stand the sight or smell of icky bodily fluids or handle crazed people? Tough; pick a different profession.
By the end of Year Three/Four - pass the Registered Nurse (RN) exam by demonstrating the core competencies listed in Appendix 5 of this link from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
At this point some students will veer off to training specific to their chosen profession, e.g. pharmacist, psychologist, social worker, doula/midwife, etc. Others will realize that they?re better with things than people and will train toward more suitable and still-needed roles such as researchers, biomedical engineers, etc.
For those wanting to become physicians - get a high score on the Medical School Admissions Test (MCAT). If the previous training wasn?t sufficient, students may need more formal study than these MCAT test prep programs provide.
Medical school itself - assume all students have the knowledge of RNs and revise book learning accordingly. Then - onto clinical practice or rotations as quickly as possible, graduation, residencies, etc. Keep the current standardized tests required before graduation.
Greatly expand programs to offset the high cost and likely indebtedness of all of the training above for hours worked in underserved communities. Think of the old ?Northern Exposure? TV program premise; expand programs that exist to aid recruitment and retention of physicians to underserved areas.
Reconsider what tasks have to be performed only with physician supervision and/or approval. Is there more that nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical psychologists, pharmacists and other trained healthcare professionals can be authorized to do?
This 6/22/20 headline should upset people, especially those who live outside of urban areas: ?42 hospitals closed, filed for bankruptcy this year?. It looks like a coalition of appropriate experts - healthcare practitioners, public health, healthcare finance, Federal and state legislators - need to establish and enforce metrics to determine how effective the various state and Federal ?Certificate of Need? programs are. In our lifetimes, healthcare practice has shifted from hospital-based to outpatient and home healthcare, from one-stop labs for multiple diagnostic tests to specialty labs doing limited types of services. Have these Certificate of Need standards changed accordingly?
Do we need a separate healthcare system for veterans? Or should all of those hospitals, outpatient clinics, etc. become community facilities? Aftercare for traumatic injuries is just that regardless of the injuries occur on a battlefield or off. Veterans now get care for diseases not connected to their service. Since Desert Storm of the early 1990s, warfare is no longer conducted by massing thousands of people near the enemy. While support groups for veterans are certainly justified - is the entire separate hospital/clinic/long-term care facility system?
Telemedicine is here to stay, but that?s made the ?digital divide? all the more obvious. Mitigation and resolution won?t be easy, and people still uncomfortable using that technology need to be encouraged toward its use, while understanding its limitations."
3910,Other,"Hello,
I received an email that Family Health Center of Boone County did not submit its Tri-Annual Progress Report. Family Health Center of Boone County merged with Compass Health, Inc. last year, so Family Health Center grant is inactive. I spoke to Alan Stevens of Compass Health. He is aware of the issue but cannot do anything because the Family Health Center's grant is in an inactive status.

I thought that when both health centers merged, all of their supplemental awards, submissions, etc. would have been merged as well.

3913,Other,"Hi, I am searching for any available financial assistance regarding my desperate need for dental implants.

Two years ago I moist my upper and lower four front teeth. I was referred to the Charlotte County Heath Department Dental Clinic. I barely could afford to have my top and bottom front only partial dentures. I have tried tiredly to adjust. They rubbed scores even though I went back for fittings. They kept falling out no matter what I tried. I was unable to talk or eat with them in. The dentist who made them recommended implants. This clinic did not offer this option. I have went to many many dental offices for consultations. Each time the bill for implants was over $23,000. One dental office could possible screw in my current partial dentures but I was told there would still be removable and as loose as I currently have. The cost just for this is over $6,000. Other dental offices offer around the same rate of $1,050 per implanted tooth. In addition to costs added four needed crowns and cleaning. This service was over $10,000 and theory sell only offered no interest payments for one year which is roughly $800.00 per month. This is about half my disability benefit check each month.

If youth could please provide with any assistance our contacts fort help or forward my information for any help I deeply appreciate time and interest.

Subject: ARP Progress Report Return Issue
 
Good Afternoon,

I returned the attached grantee ARP progress report yesterday, to the grantee, for corrections. The grantee could see the return in EHB this morning but could not make the requested changes in the report and later today did not see the report at all to return it to my queue in EHB. The help desk informed the grantee that it indicated ?admin closed?.

 

Is it possible to reopen the submission for the grantee to return the ARP progress report so it can be approved and closed out on my end?

Thank you for your attention and response to this request.

 

Warmest Regards,

Mavis

4123,Other,"Hello Helpline,

Per our meeting with OIT and DMI on 2/28, here is the ticket for an operations task.

We would like for the following actions to take place with the monthly reporting requirement submissions for all 29 of the Q8V awards:
?	Administratively close the 3/5/22 submissions, even for those that are currently in-progress
       o	Rationale ? the award start date is 3/1, so not enough time has elapsed for the awardees to have conducted activities with this funding to report out to HRSA
?	Starting with the April 2022 submissions, move all submissions to an ?unassigned pool? and administratively close the submission on the 6th of each month
     o	Rationale ? HRSA has decided that a formal processing of these submissions is not needed, as it will take time away from the delivery and analysis of the information by the contractor supporting the evaluation of the awardees? progress.  HRSA staff will be reviewing the submissions outside of a formal EHB workflow, and following up with awardees when there are issues/deficiencies that need to be addressed.
?	A .zip file will be created and sent to identified HRSA recipients on the 10th of each month to include all monthly submissions

Thank you,
Karl"

This condition was noted on the NoA dated 08/25/2021. The health center met the condition, and submitted the appropriate change in scope requests to address the condition. However, the health center failed to submit their response to the 90 day condition and provide a narrative via the EHB (so that the condition could be lifted via the system).  It advanced to 60-day during the transition of grants to the new functional area and lapsed again, however, the health center has met the condition and the Point of Contact (POC) is prepared to upload documentation that the condition has been met. Therefore, requesting that this submission, Tracking# 00324666 be administratively opened so the POC can process by uploading documentation, and lifting the condition with no further progressive action to 30-days."

4131,Other,"To Whom it may concern:

This question is regarding the HRSA COVID uninsured program (not the provider relief fund, not the HRSA COVID-19 Coverage Assistance Fund) I have called the help line at Provider Support Line: 866-569-3522 and so I am aware of the information I can get on the phone and I am looking for something in writing according to my question.  If you are not the right entity to ask this question I would be much obliged if you could direct me on how to get an answer in writing related to my question for the HRSA COVID uninsured program.  

The question is when a laboratory I bill for gets a denial from an insurance company for COVID 19 diagnostic testing and the denial is for either no benefits for the patient or because the provider (the lab) is not credentialed with the payor (some of the Medicaid plans and HMO's under commercial payors will not allow us to credential the laboratory stating that the network is full) can I take that denial and bill it to the HRSA COVID uninsured program?  Now I am clear that the HRSA COVID uninsured program is for the uninsured and not the underinsured BUT it clearly states on the FAQ page on question 5 under the eligibility tab the following ?The HRSA COVID-19 Uninsured Program reimburses eligible claims for COVID-19 testing, treatment, and vaccination for individuals with limited Medicaid benefits if the Medicaid plan does not cover these services.?.

So I am trying to figure out if this only applies to Medicaid plans or can it also apply to MCO's, HMO's etc. and how I can go about getting my lab paid when these plans use this type of denial.

Hi,

Pro#5322065162 has been reviewed as requested. Please be advised that the invoice billing to your account is the liftgate delivery fee which is valid.

If you want to rebill it, a letter of authorization with a company letterhead or company email signature is needed from a different debtor accepting the fee.

We have many claims that were submitted prior to the deadling but UHC said they were not in their system. I asked for the call to get escalated and spoke with someone in the backend. She stated to me that the claims were in their system but not released due to direction from HRSA These claims were for monoclonal Antibodies specifically Regencov and Bam/Ete Combo medications, which had their approval put on hold on 1/24/2022 by the FDA. I was told by UHC that all claims recevied for these two products were not to be processed. I believe this is a misunderstanding from UHC because claims received after 1/24/2022 for dates of service prior when the medications were approve should have been paid. We have over 240 claims pending payment for services rendered. Could you please help me find the person or office that needs to look into this.

Good morning,

I am contacting you from Careteam Plus, Inc. LAL -  in regards to not receiving the latest HRSA COVID-19 Survey that would typically be due today May 24th at 11:59pm.     We have contacted BPHC and spoke with a representative who put in a ticket for us and additionally, we filled out the BPHC Contact Form expressing our issue.

If someone could please contact us in regards to this matter ? we want to ensure that our agency continues receiving vaccines.  Our concern is not having the updated link to conduct the survey that is needed to be submitted bi-weekly.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this issue

To whom it may concern,

 

I have a grantee who is having issues finding the  SF-424A and Budget Narrative to complete OHI-Final Cost Information submission. I would like your assistance in resolving the grantee issue.

 

 

Subject #: Boundary Regional Community Health Center - General H80 Award - Program Updates/Concerns

Status: Open

Description: This is in regards to award H80CS00302, tracking number 00284409.

 

I am in the EHB filling out the OHI - Final Cost Information and the submission is asking me for these items:  Based on your receipt of the FY 2019 Oral Health Infrastructure (OHI) supplemental funding for physical and/or organizational infrastructure enhancements that support new or enhance existing high quality, integrated oral health services, you must submit into HRSA's Electronic Handbook within 90 days of the end of your FY 2021 Budget Period a final detailed SF-424A and line-item narrative description of both Federal and non-Federal costs incurred for the completed activities supported with OHI funding.  You must also submit a final equipment list (when applicable).  The SF-424A, a sample narrative and a blank equipment list can be found at https://bphc.hrsa.gov/program-opportunities/oral-health.

 

According to the FY-2019 Oral Heal Infrastructure site on HRSA, the SF-424A and Budget Narrative should be entered directly into the EHB. I currently do not see that option for this submission. I am only seeing an option to upload documents. All I have been able to complete fully is an equipment list. I am not finding an SF-424A and Budget Narrative that I can fill out. I have only found templates. Can you please provide assistance so I can complete this submission?"

After conversations with previous and current Team Leaders and the HC Support, we agreed that Morovis? Form 5B accurately demonstrates the NAP Vega Alta (attached).  We further agreed that the task pending verification is an old task that while associated was replaced by the site verification when the NAP Vega Alta site and was correctly added to scope as shown on Form 5B.  The HC Support colleague (Bona!) is coordinating the removal of the old task pending verification dated 01-29-2020.  Morovis,  NAP Vega Alta Site id: BPS-H80-030291 is shown on EHB as pending on the screen changes in scope in error and should be removed by the HC Support.  Morovis CHC has an upcoming vOSV and asks to clear the Pending Verification task  Site id:BPS-80-030291 only.   On the other hand, Morovis Form 5B shows the Vega Alta site as active under Site Id: BPS-H8031215 correctly.     

In a follow-up conversation with the grantee, they shared how their screen shows 4 sites listed below including the H80-030291 (in error) as pending verification yet POs Form 5B screen (attached) only shows 3 sites (correctly).

Kindly find attached a copy of the current Form 5B as shown in the EHB with three active sites:

4340,Other,"My name is Alicia I. Lavergne Ramírez, Esq. and am an attorney from a Puerto Rico law firm, Sánchez/LRV LLC.  We represent a drug manufacturer that manufactures HIV medications which are sold to the Puerto Rico government and are paid with Ryan White legislation funds, 42 U.S.C.A. §§ 300ff-11 et seq.
The Puerto Rico government filed for bankruptcy under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (?PROMESA?) on May 3, 2017 [NO FUE 2016?]. As part of the bankruptcy procedures, the Puerto Rico government has filed complaints, seeking the avoidance and recovery of transfers made to certain suppliers in the four years prior to the government?s filing for protection under Title III of PROMESA, among them our client. The monies paid were for HIV medicines bought by and delivered to the government during those four years. The Puerto Rico government alleges that it was insolvent when it paid the monies.  Therefore, the Puerto Rico government reasoned, (i) the transactions could be avoided, and (ii) the monies paid to such suppliers, included our drug manufacturer client, must be returned to it. 
We believe that transfers made using U.S. federal funds were not made from property of the debtor or the estate, which would otherwise be subject to recovery under the avoidance sections of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code included in Title III of PROMESA. Moreover, we understand those U.S. federal funds granted by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) are subject to strict restrictions and can be traced to HRSA, which would mean that HRSA would be the correct party-in-interest with respect to those funds.
We would respectfully like to discuss this issue further with you and, if you agree, propose the scheduling of a virtual meeting with the relevant officers of HRSA.
We thank you for your attention to this matter.

We have partnered with Phila College of Osteopathic Medicine and are dedicated to providing services to underserved communities. We currently have 13 locations in the Philadelphia metro area. We were able to stand up telemed services back in March of 2020 and to date have provided over 100,000 COVID tests to our communities. Our front line staff and clinicians have worked tirelessly this past year to ensure that access to high quality health care was, and is, available to everyone who needs it. We have recently partnered with the Phila DOH to begin mass COVID vaccination clinics for the DOH designated recipients. We will be starting with the remainder of the 1a and 1b group on Wed, March 3rd.

Our clinic at 2574 San Bruno Avenue, San Francisco (Site ID BPS-H80-009132) was added to our federal project scope in 2009, which predates the transition of the 340B registration process from OPAIS to Apexus/340BPVP. 

The chronology of events is as follows: NEMS submitted a Change in Scope request on 9/2/2009 in anticipation of the site opening in November 2009. We then registered the site into the 340B program on 9/17/2009 and were approved on 9/18/2009, with an effective date on 10/1/2009. The site was added to our project scope in EHB on 9/24/2009. Although we intended for the clinic to be open/operational in November 2009, we did not actually become operational until 12/7/2009, and this was duly recorded in our project scope and EHB. As you can see, there has been a discrepancy between our 340B effective date of 10/1/2009 and our EHB operational date of 12/7/2009 since the very beginning.

We have been advised by 340B experts that this date discrepancy may create an audit/compliance issue in the future. We have contacted OPAIS to inquire if the 340B registration date can be changed, and it looks unlikely. We assume that it will be difficult to change the operational date in EHB as well. Therefore, we would like to request formal written confirmation that the date discrepancy is recognized/acknowledged and that changes cannot be made. At least with this written confirmation, we can present it as proof of due diligence should 340B or other auditors question the issue in the future.

Thanks in advance for your assistance!"

Hello,

As a part of the COVID-19 emergency response, please take a few minutes to fill out HRSA?s COVID-19 survey<https://hrsa.force.com/HRSABPHC/s/health-center-survey>. You or anyone in your organization can complete the survey. It will require your H80 number in order to submit a response.



The deadline for this survey is 11:59 p.m. your local time on Tuesday, May 18.

IMPORTANT: This survey is asking ONLY about your health center?s experience beginning on Saturday, May 8, through Friday, May 14. Please do not report on information outside of this timeframe.

If you skipped a week, please do NOT report two weeks of data in one survey. Report ONLY data for the timeframe above.



NEW THIS WEEK!

Given the expansion of eligibility to include children ages 12 and up, we have altered two questions to better understand the efforts to vaccinate this population. We added ?school-based vaccination clinics? to questions 17 and 17a:

  *   Did your health center utilize mobile vans, host pop-up clinics, and/or host school-based vaccination clinics to enhance access to COVID-19 vaccination sites in the last week?
  *   How many mobile van clinics, pop-up clinics, and/or school-based vaccination clinics did you host in the last week for COVID-19 vaccinations?

For Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program participants, we also made changes to the addendum questions 25 and 26. For both, we now ask you to report the vaccines you administer to children (patients less than 18 years).



Reminders

The Survey Tool User Guide<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-data-collection-survey-tool-user-guide> explains the data we?re collecting and offers instructions for completing each question, including those in the addendum.


Attention Health Center Vaccine Program Participants:

  *   As a reminder, you are required to complete this survey, including the addendum that is visible only to Vaccine Program participants who received vaccine in the past week.
  *   IMPORTANT: The survey must be completed in one sitting. It is not possible to save partial answers and continue at a later time. It may be helpful to review a preview of the surve<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-survey-tools-questions>y or the User Guide<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-data-collection-survey-tool-user-guide> before beginning.

Hello,

As a part of the COVID-19 emergency response, please take a few minutes to fill out HRSA?s COVID-19 survey<https://hrsa.force.com/HRSABPHC/s/health-center-survey>. You or anyone in your organization can complete the survey. It will require your H80 number in order to submit a response.



The deadline for this survey is 11:59 p.m. your local time on Tuesday, May 18.

IMPORTANT: This survey is asking ONLY about your health center?s experience beginning on Saturday, May 8, through Friday, May 14. Please do not report on information outside of this timeframe.

If you skipped a week, please do NOT report two weeks of data in one survey. Report ONLY data for the timeframe above.



NEW THIS WEEK!

Given the expansion of eligibility to include children ages 12 and up, we have altered two questions to better understand the efforts to vaccinate this population. We added ?school-based vaccination clinics? to questions 17 and 17a:

  *   Did your health center utilize mobile vans, host pop-up clinics, and/or host school-based vaccination clinics to enhance access to COVID-19 vaccination sites in the last week?
  *   How many mobile van clinics, pop-up clinics, and/or school-based vaccination clinics did you host in the last week for COVID-19 vaccinations?

For Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program participants, we also made changes to the addendum questions 25 and 26. For both, we now ask you to report the vaccines you administer to children (patients less than 18 years).

4469,Other,"Hi there!

I hope I'm submitting this to the correct recipient - if not, please let me know who would be better to contact. I highly recommend that whomever oversees Ryan White funding investigate the relationship between Health Services of North Texas and Texas' Ryan White-funded medication program as they are clearly working together to deliberately interrupt and impede their clients' access to medication through the state program. This has taken the form of forging and falsifying documents, ie deliberately filling out client paperwork with incorrect information resulting in months of medication interruption, failing to complete state program renewals so that their clients are kicked off the state program with no warning - again, resulting in months of interruption, on top of the state program itself being designed to interrupt clients' receipt of medication as they will only approve refill prescriptions the week the previous Rxs ended, resulting in at least a week of delay between refills. Of course, these medications must be adhered to at 95% or better to avoid clients developing resistance to the medication, but HSNT and the state of Texas don't care - I'm resistant to many medications now because all they care about is kicking people off the program and keeping them off the program. And if people somehow do get on the program and manage to stay on it, then they can look forward to Texas saving a week out of every month of medication they're supposed to be providing by sending it a week late every time, and they are deducting that directly from their clients' lifespans. I know of two other people who have had the same experiences. Please investigate the relationship of these organizations and please evaluate the standard of care provided by these organizations which use your funding.

Subject: Mental Health and/or SUD LRP

Hello,

My name is Dr. Daniel Severn, DO,MPA and I am a board certified psychiatrist and addictions medicine specialist that is interested in your loan repayment program for Mental Health or SUD through the NHSC.  I currently work for Denver Health Hospital and Authority full time in various areas. I understand that my facility is a Federally Qualified Health Center.  My time is currently split up in 3 different areas:   The first is at our detox and treatment center called Denver Cares, 1 day a week which serves the homeless and underserved with substance use disorders,  the second is through a contract between Denver Health and Crossroads Turning Point by telemedicine, several hours a week which services underserved substance abuse patients in a rural area, of Alamosa, Colorado, and finally, I work in a dedicated emergency psychiatric services that provides medical detox, buprenorphine induction and other mental health services on an emergent basis to the homeless, underserved and anyone needing mental health treatment regardless of their ability to pay.  I am wondering if the above services could be considered for LRP.  I have a Suboxone Data Waiver.

I am a former National Health Services Corps Scholar and completed my service at the Federal Correction Complex in Florence, CO.  This included the provision of services at the ADX, Federal Supermax over a 4 year period. My years of service were from 2008-2012.  I still have some Federal Student Loans that need to be repaid and would like to explore various avenues above for doing so.  Please let me know.

Sincerely,

Dan

Yes, they will be generating encounters at the site. They are planning to offer weekly vaccine and weekly COVID testing services?ideally once a week, plus more if groups of farmworkers need that support.

Dear Sam

As discussed, and per the information you provided me, I am requesting addition of an emergency service site to the administrative site at 9 Green Street. 

1. Health center name: Maine Mobile Health Program

2. The name of a health center representative and this person?s contact information: Lisa Tapert, CEO, contact information below

3. A brief description of the declared emergency: The State of Emergency related to COVID-19 was most recently renewed in Maine April 14, 2021 

https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-continues-state-civil-emergency-maine-fights-covid-19-2021-04-14


4. A brief description of planned emergency response activities at the proposed temporary service site. (This should be no more than one to two sentences.) 

MMHP?s Administrative Site at 9 Green Street currently receives and stores vaccine and vaccine supplies from the State of Maine, however it is not listed as a provider site with HRSA. All vaccine supplies are transmitted to MMHP service sites (4 mobile units) and mobile vaccination clinics are held. MMHP is not currently serving patients at 9 Green Street, but plans to provide vaccination and COVID testing for individuals in the program and staff when mobile clinics are not scheduled. The vaccination and COVID tested will be performed by MMHP?s Registered Nurse. MMHP requests to add Temporary Service to this Administrative Site in which receipt and administration of COVID vaccine and testing can take place. 

5. A summary of the requested change in scope of project, including:

The address is 9 Green Street, Augusta, Maine 04332. Emergency response activities will start upon approval from HRSA of this change. All applicable criteria for adding a temporary site will be met. 

              Effective date: 4/23/21 

Thanks for all your help!

In 2013county was devastated by the loss of its local hospital. The nearest hospital is more than 25 miles in either direction. Five hospitals in the state of Georgia are closed. Macon County is one of them. Many people have left this county in search of a better way of life. What happens to the people that have nowhere to go? The nearest VA Hospital is about two hours away. There are no taxi's or little transit systems available in this county. Macon County Transit System has contracted its transit system to a third-party.

Good afternoon Kathy,


In regard to below and attached adjustment in scope that the board has approved, I attached 2 documents to support the Bethune site address change. Again, it is listed on Form 5B attached as ?103 Main St N Bldg, Bethune, SC 29009?, but it should be ?103 Main St South, Bethune, SC 29009?. This was due to being told the wrong address by the Town that owns the building when we started leasing it. We also called and spoke with county mapping who finally decided on ?South?. So we began this process of correcting it. Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thank you."

Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or the President of the

event by an authorized public official.

As a result of the continued consequences of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-

determined on January 31, 2020 that a public health emergency exists and has
existed since January 27th, 2020 nationwide. In the State of Maine, the
determination was renewed on April 14, 2021 with an ending date of June 30, 2021.
Since August 1, 2021 the State of Maine has experienced a steady increase of
COVID cases, including hospitalizations and Washington County, Maine is
currently in the Red Zone regarding transmissions.

4. A brief description of planned emergency response activities at the proposed
temporary service site. (This should be no more than one to two sentences.)
SCRFHC will provide primary and preventative care, to the school-based health
center, Calais Blue Devil Health Center, patients and will provide COVID-19 testing
as needed. Services will be provided via telehealth and/or in-person from 8:30am ?
10:30am Wednesday and Friday.

5. A summary of the requested change in scope of project, including: temporary
address information, and the date emergency response activities at the site were
initiated (if they have already started).

Due to the COVID-19?s impact in Maine and to provide primary care to the patients

Calais Blue Devil Health Center patients on September 3, 2021.

6. Explanation and/or assurance that each of the applicable criteria for adding a
temporary service site will be met.

would like to add this school-based health center, Calais Blue Devil Health Center,
as a temporary site to continue to provide much needed primary care and
preventative services to the current patients of the Calais Blue Devil Health
Center. Services will be provided by the SCRFHC?s credentialed staff. This
temporary service site is in our current service area, and we share many of the
same patients. Services will continue at the St. Croix Regional Family Health

Subject: ACTION REQUIRED BY 11:59 p.m. Local Time Tuesday Sept 14th: Health Center COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Tracking Survey


Hello,

As a part of the COVID-19 emergency response, please take a few minutes to fill out HRSA?s COVID-19 survey<https://hrsa.force.com/HRSABPHC/s/health-center-survey>. You or anyone in your organization can complete the survey. It will require your H80 number in order to submit a response.



The deadline for this survey is 11:59 p.m. your local time on Tuesday, September 14.



IMPORTANT: We are asking about your health center?s experience for the past TWO weeks: beginning on Saturday, August 28, through Friday, September 10. Please report information for this entire timeframe?but ONLY this timeframe.



With today?s survey, we added questions about the administration of additional doses for those who are moderately to severely immunocompromised:



?       Question 15: How many of your patients received an additional dose by race and ethnicity?



This is in the main part of the survey, for all health centers/look-alikes.



We also added questions in the survey addendum (for Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program participants) to understand how you used vaccines allocated through the program for additional doses:



?       Question 20: How many staff received an additional dose?

?       Questions 23 and 26: How many patients (by race and ethnicity and by special population) received an additional dose?



The Survey Tool User Guide<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-data-collection-survey-tool-user-guide> reflects these changes and can be helpful in understanding how to report this data.



Reminders

The Survey Tool User Guide<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-data-collection-survey-tool-user-guide> explains the data we?re collecting and offers instructions for completing each question, including those in the addendum.



Attention Health Center Vaccine Program Participants:

  *   As a reminder, you are required to complete this survey, including the addendum that is visible only to Vaccine Program participants.
  *   IMPORTANT: The survey must be completed in one sitting. It is not possible to save partial answers and continue at a later time. It may be helpful to review a preview of the surve<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-survey-tools-questions>y or the User Guide<https://bphc.hrsa.gov/emergency-response/covid-19-data-collection-survey-tool-user-guide> before beginning.

Bookmark the Link

Just a reminder: The link for the survey is actually the same each time. So, although we?ll continue to send emails, you do not have to wait to begin the survey! Bookmark the link above so you can quickly access the survey during the open period (beginning at 5:00 p.m. ET every other Friday ? the following Tuesday at 11:59 p.m. your local time).

Subject: Form 5B update
 
Hi,

Byrant Goodine, JHC?s PO suggested I outreach to Tier II support.

We have discussed this update in the past & the thought was we needed to delete the site & re-add it with the correct address.

Cymara Tolbert who was our HRSA representative for our OSV had mentioned this Form 5B update could be done without deleting/re-adding the location from scope with the following information:

 

JHC would like to update an address for one of our locations ? Site ID# BPS-H80-003753:

               James River Dental Clinic

               239 Trojan Rd.

               Lynchburg, Va  24572

 

It read as:

               James River Dental Clinic

               239 Trojan Rd.

               Madison Heights, Va  24572

 

The town was incorrectly listed as Lynchburg; however the street address & zip code are correct.

Attached is an internet bill for the location showing the correct address & a letter attestation from CEO/Gary regarding the same.

 

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Thank-you,

judy

Hi,

Thank you for the vaccines provided to us by HRSA.  You are part of our team that is working diligently toward our vaccine efforts in our community.

Yes, we are planning on having pediatric vaccine clinics.  We anticipate 3-4 vaccine clinics a week and also plan to vaccinate our pediatric patients at all 13 of our clinic?s during normal patient visits.

Please note that our CEO is working with the City of Long Beach Health Department (Our Local Jurisdiction) and the Long Beach Unified School District to coordinate pediatric COVID-19 vaccines to the 5-11 pediatric populations in our community.

I know the HRSA is exclusively for US citizens, and I absolutely understand if you disregard this message immediately and give me a flat NO. I didn't want to quit without trying.

I tried a workaround, to ""register"" another site with the same name, but I get the error message that I cannot create another entity with the same name.

Subject: Your Health Center?s Plans for Family Vaccination Clinics

No.

We have weekly vaccine clinics but have Moderna and only a few doses of pediatric Pfizer because we don?t have ultrafreezer to keep them longer than 6 weeks. If we could start with 100 doses of Pfizer adults then we could maybe do a family clinic. But right now, Moderna for adults is our only option and therefore we cannot vaccinate 12-17 year olds.
Thank you.

We?d like a single representative for your health center (regardless of the number of sites) to share whether or not your health center plans to host or participate in family vaccination clinics that are designed to make it easy and comfortable for families to get COVID-19 shots. Family vaccination clinics are intended for the whole family?offering primary vaccinations and booster shots, and the pediatric vaccine for kids ages 5-11.

Resources and Articles
The Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) recommends team-based care to improve blood pressure control. A systematic review of evidence from 54 studies shows team-based care increases the proportion of patients with controlled blood pressure and reduces systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure. A separate review of economic evidence from 27 studies indicates team-based care is also cost-effective. These findings update and replace the 2012 CPSTF recommendation for team-based care. CPSTF also recommends team-based care for patients with type 2 diabetes.

I went there and paid $165 for a COVID test out of pocket although I had insurance.  I went back in and asked whether or not they took insurance and the lady at the desk told me they did not.  If I had known that I would have never gone to that clinic for a test but tensions were still high and I had been exposed to COVID 19 at my job.  Tests were scarce and I had to get one done.  The amount shocked me and I just happened to have that in my bank account so I could get out of there.   It was November 17 or 18 of 2020 and I never got around to asking or finding out if I could possibly get that fee refunded.

Central St., Hodge, LA 71247, due to the Louisiana State COVID-19 Declaration of Emergency in response to a public healthcare crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic with a requested effective date of 01/11/2021 for 90 days. 

The LAL?s temporary service site establishment request was initially sent to HSO on 01/07/2021 with a requested effective date of 01/11/2021 for 90 days. Due to an administrative error, the initial temporary site establishment CIS request was not processed properly by former monitoring PO Rishelle Anthony. 

To address this error, HSO PAO/Deputy Division Director approved the temporary service site request effective 01/11/2021 for 90 days (please see attached PAO approval email for reference). 

Per the Formal CIS SOP, PO contacted Health Center Program Support to establish the initial temporary site and approval Notice of Look-alike Designation (NLD) however the ticket # 01266208 was closed because HCPS noted additional approval from OPPD was required since the effective date is past the 90-day period.

HSO contacted OPPD via the Policy Portal, and OPPD responded to the issue and approved HSO?s request to establish a temporary service site, effective 01/11/2021 for 90 days (please see attached OPPD approval email for reference).

5132,Other,"The Post Office has assigned a unique address to our school-based health center in order to segregate the delivery of mail, which has previously been delivered to the school's address.  There has not been any change in the location, just a new address that was assigned by Polk County FL 911 has been substituted for the 700 Galvin Avenue site.  The School based health center is located in two modular buildings that are attached with an enclosed walkway connecting them.  This was necessary to allow general community patients to enter through a seperate door and receive services in clinical space that is not utilized for students. This is necessary to conform to Florida law that prohibits non- school- based patients from being served in the same space as school-based services. 

In addition, CFHC wants to assure that patient privacy in correspondence is maintained through a chain of custody that does not involve mail being received and processed by non-health center staff.

The new address does not constitute a new site, only an administrative address assignment from the post office. What is the correct procedure for recoring this change in our site listing and scope?"
5133,Other,"I need to speak with someone concerning my HRSA loan.  I recently worked at an FQHC clinic (Amite County Medical Services) and was granted a monetary award by HRSA.  During my time at this clinic, the work environment was very hostile and toxic.  The physician at this clinic was practicing pain management out of a primary care clinic prescribing copious amounts of schedule II drugs.  He was also having sexual relations with his nurse, who was also his patient.  This is a crime.  The entire clinic environment was hostile and toxic.  I was unaware of this behavior until after I started working full time at this clinic ( I was contract for a few months prior to being hired full-time).  After I became aware of these situations, I notified administration and no action was taken.  The work environment became worse.  I met with administration at least weekly about what was going on at this clinic.  Eventually, the physician's wife found out about his affair with the nurse at work and the wife barged in the clinic and used vulgar language to the nurse with patients in the clinic.  After that, administration did become involved and separated the physician and the nurse for a short while, but eventually placed them back together.  The physician's wife sued the nurse and the nurse became suicidal at work in my office due to the circumstances and stress of the relationship and the physician taking advantage of her.  I gave a direct order to the RN to take the nurse to the ER for an emergent psych evaluation at this time.  The nurse had a plan to end her life and was truly suicidal.  The RN and the administrator of the clinic dismissed my order and let the nurse leave the clinic in her vehicle while she was suicidal (this is against the law).  I met with the RN and the administrator the next morning for three hours about this situation.  At this point, I did not know what to do to make administration understand how serious this situation was.  Every employee at the clinic knew and was afraid of the physician's wife coming to the clinic because she had done this more than once, even after administration told us (the employees) that she was no longer allowed at our clinic.  I talked with Tina Highfill at the MS Board of Nursing about the situation and she informed me that this physician, Dr. James L. Wootton, was not fit to collaborate with any NP at this point and she recommended me to remove myself from that clinic immediately.  After my phone call with the MS BON, I called the administrator of the clinic for a meeting.  I let her know in the meeting that I would not be able to work at the clinic anymore.  The clinic administrator did not understand why I could not practice and I tried to explain to her why, but she did not understand.  Then, she asked me to go on the MS BON site and just add a physician on to collaborate with and I told her it did not work like that (that would be illegal and not approved by the BON or BOM).  I have been in healthcare for 30 years and this is the most toxic, hostile work environment I have ever been exposed to.  I had signed a contract for loan repayment while at the clinic and that contract does not end until August 2022.  I would like to file some kind of claim to release me from this agreement.  I love my patients and I love my community, but I would never consider working in this environment again.  The physician at this clinic was suspended by the Mississippi Board of Medicine on January 20, 2022.  The nurse (who was also his patient) is still working at the clinic.  Please contact me via email or phone about this matter.  
Kind Regards,

I hope this finds everyone safe and well. My name is Monica and I was seen at ROADS Community Care Clinic on October 28, 2021. At the time of my visit, I was unemployed and uninsured. I was signed up for the sliding fee scale, in which I had to pay $30 for the visit and $2 for each additional lab, after the 2 labs that were included. I paid the $32, as I needed the care they offered. But I received a bill from Quest Diagnostic, for $1.031.12. Because of sliding fee scale, I was informed that the clinic will cover any remaining costs. I have contacted several staff members, supervisors, and management, but none have returned my calls or emails. This is not how an FQHC is supposed to treat people in need. Because of this inconvenience, I am receiving notices from quest. Will you be able to assist or guide to the right department that can help with this dispute?

5192,Other,"RE:  340B Recertification Technical issues in accessing the website and not being able to comply with deadline.

We, at Vida Y Salud-Health Systems, Inc., have been having difficulty logging in to the 340B Office of Pharmacy Affairs (OPAIS) website to complete the annual 304B Recertification process.
 
With the upcoming deadline on Monday, February 28, 2022 we are getting concerned that we will not be able to meet the deadline.
 
I have been in contact with Apexus Answers (OPAIS? helpdesk) and opened up two case resolution numbers (#00234264 and #00234393).  Unfortunately no resolution was reached as we are still not able to log in even after following their recommendations.
 
The issue is that it accepts the username and the password but once we sign in, we have to wait for an Authentication code sent to our email and that is where the problem lies.  Our email setup is that all emails go to our PCA and are filtered there before being routed to our internal email and also pass through its own filter.  This has delayed the retrieval of the code and it takes an average of 8 minutes before we actually receive it.  We enter the code and ?Submit? however due to the length of time it takes to receive it, it times out the log in process and it throws us back to the beginning of the log in.  It is a never-ending process.
 
We are working closely with our PCA to try to make the necessary changes to hopefully achieve success.  We will continue to work on this issue.
 
Do you have any recommendations that can assist us?"

The COVID-19 Pandemic is still prevalent within our community.  ACR health reached out to UFHC seeking these COVID support services for their population, a population which is largely affected by a wide range of chronic diseases.

UFHC will provide on sight primary and preventative care services including a conduit for mental health care.  UFHC (along with partners with whom we have shared our CLIA Certificate) has performed well over 50,000 COVID tests and has administered over 7000 vaccines to some of the Mohawk Valleys most vulnerable individuals of all ages.  While on site, we will be performing health assessments and primary care to those having challenges coming into our main location.

The COVID-19 Pandemic is still prevalent within the homeless community.  The homeless population have been impacted by this pandemic due to inadequate access to hygiene and sanitation facilities, or connection to services and healthcare.  Lack of transportation and lack of health literacy amongst the homeless has created challenges with this particular population.  We do also offer Tele-visits,  for many homeless, those who have a disability, or who has English as a second language see this as an obstacle to seeing a medical provider.

The COVID-19 Pandemic is still prevalent within our community.  Within the Waterville district, there is limited access to primary care services in the area.  Several families lack reliable transportation to travel outside of the area.  Waterville has followed New York State guidelines and students need to be tested and medically cleared before the district will allow students who exhibit signs of COVID to return to school.  Without proper transportation, these students are often left ?in limbo? being forced to remain home until cleared medically.  Having a provider imbedded in school will allow this clearance to happen quickly resulting in less missed school time.

I have two tasks in EHB that have been showing as overdue since before I took over this role (2021). I was originally informed by my predecessor that they were errors, and I should ignore them, but they?re causing some confusion. Is it possible to have them removed? The tracking numbers are 00208289 and 00231770 . I submitted a ticket with EHB (01313909), and they advised me to contact my PO.  My PO and her Deputy Division Director, Anthony Jordan, said to resubmit through the contact form. Can you please assist?"
