3153,Help/Assistance,"need to speak to someone about careteam plus in Conway south Carolina. 
The director there is Johanna and this place needs to be investigated. 

They do not have a board for the patients to file complaints to because the director does not want it. They can not keep staff at all. The doctors leave and they get new ones. This place needs to be investigated by the state. All the money that is given to them and nothing is being done. I have contacted dhec as well and they are investigating as well.  not sure who I need to speak to or get something done about this."
