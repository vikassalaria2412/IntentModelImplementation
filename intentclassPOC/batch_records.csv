"Good afternoon!

My name is Jasmin Fosheim. I'm an economic developer and grant writer in Hettinger, North Dakota.
 

I'm reaching out because I'm working with a small business here in Hettinger who provides in-home physical therapy to a large region within and beyond Hettinger. This service has been vital to our community, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the inability of older clients to travel. They are running into financial hardship, however, because of the number of windshield hours required to reach their clients. Although they can get comp-ed for mileage, their windshield time is not billable.
 

That said, they are looking for any support there might be for this specific area in which they are spending too much time and money with little return. Is there any chance you know of any programs they might be eligible for or organizations that might be able to provide support for this business model?

Thanks in advance for your time. Take care, Jasmin."

However, when I try to run reports, the system tells me I am not logged into AMS and it puts me in a loop that I can't get out of.  I login to AMS, try again, and when I try to run a report it just keeps telling me I'm not logged into AMS even though I am.

Did you confirm the role modification in the test environment or in the live environment?

Hi Hashini and Dana ?



I hope you had a nice weekend! I am wondering if you are aware of any way to expedite an update to EHB role modifications.



We have a funding memo due at the end of this week and Ayanna did not have the PGA role to be able to initiate and complete the FM. I requested the role modification early on Friday and it said it can take 3-4 business days. Are you aware of any way to expedite the request? It?s a generic EHB role, so am hoping it doesn?t require a lot of extra approvals.



Here is a screenshot with the request tracking number ?

Thanks, Erica!  I called and spoke with Nikeya at the helpdesk.  She had to forward the case onto someone else, so they are still working on it.  She said I should hear back in the next couple of days.



In case you need it for reference,  a new case number was assigned, 01073243.



Thanks,

Rachel

Thanks for checking on this!  The problem is that these are both coming back as an error, saying they are required fields.  I believe last time this delayed our submission because we were not able to submit the report with errors, so I just wanted to try preventing it from happening again.

Hi Rachel,



Thank you for keeping me in the loop.

I checked with our system developers on your issue and this is okay.

The fields are greyed out because they cannot be overwritten.



Take care,

Hi Erica,

I hope you are doing well!  Dr. Admon has begun working on her final report for grant R40MC32882, which is due 1/29/21.  However, we are having some of the same issues that we did in a previous report.  In Form 6, there is nothing filled in for the Aim and it is grayed out.  Also, there is the same problem with the Objective on Core 1, Tier 2.  I believe both of these should be auto populated.  Can you please assist with this?



Thanks,

Rachel

Hi Hashini and Dana ?



I hope you had a nice weekend! I am wondering if you are aware of any way to expedite an update to EHB role modifications.



We have a funding memo due at the end of this week and Ayanna did not have the PGA role to be able to initiate and complete the FM. I requested the role modification early on Friday and it said it can take 3-4 business days. Are you aware of any way to expedite the request? It?s a generic EHB role, so am hoping it doesn?t require a lot of extra approvals.



Here is a screenshot with the request tracking number ?

Subject: Expedite EHB Role Modification Approval?



Hi Hashini and Dana ?



I hope you had a nice weekend! I am wondering if you are aware of any way to expedite an update to EHB role modifications.



We have a funding memo due at the end of this week and Ayanna did not have the PGA role to be able to initiate and complete the FM. I requested the role modification early on Friday and it said it can take 3-4 business days. Are you aware of any way to expedite the request? It?s a generic EHB role, so am hoping it doesn?t require a lot of extra approvals.



Here is a screenshot with the request tracking number ?

"I believe REI has shared the DGIS Release 1 requirements with you where it was noted that CB 7 should be removed as an option to allow ?assignment?, since CB 7 is a retired form and should not be assigned to any MCHB program going forward.

Therefore, this request is to remove CB 7 from all existing DGIS Form Assignments.  Note: As you all work on this request, it may be helpful if you could run a query to determine if there are any remaining activity codes with CB 7 assigned. I am sure you all remember my previous request for H18 where CB 7 has already been removed.

Please remove CB 7 from the following activity codes: H61, U22, U40, UG8.  CB 7 should not be included in any future DGIS performance Reports.

NOTE: These changes must occur before the next set of performance reports are created for these activity codes.  Note:  I believe H61 grants will be first since they have a BPSD of 4/1. 

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Description:

My Part D recipient needs to submit a prior approval request in EHB. They need to request approval to modify their budget, and have chosen the rebudgeting request type which I believe is the correct request type. When the form populates, only one SF-424 loads, the R&R one. They need to complete a SF-424A, not an R&R. There is no option to select the SF-424A. What is going on?

Detailed description of the Issue

The recipient for County of Dallas cannot start their Part A CARES Act Recipient Report (H9AHA36927) due to 3 of their providers already being in ?Submitted? status. Note that the larger issue here is that the 3 providers were able to submit their reports without all of their recipients being in ?Certified? status. This is a system error that is allowing them to do so.

Two asks:

Could you please move the H9AHA36927 Recipient Report into ?Working? status.
Could you please change the logic in the system that is allowing Providers to submit their Provider Reports before all of their recipients have Certified their Recipient Reports.

"Hello,

I am trying to finish the Ocracoke Health Centers? OSV conduct module (SV-008956). When I try add conditions, I am having an issue. I go into add key finding, fill out the information on the front page, including selecting the key finding (in this instance Required and Additional Services, but I do have several more that need to be placed), and selecting ?condition? at the bottom of the page. Then I select save and continue. It brings me to the page where I can usually select the condition I want to be placed, however when I select the drop down to choose a condition, it has 100 or more conditions listed from all requirements at all levels of progressive action). And, looking through the list, it does not seem to have the one I need. Usually it only lists the conditions associated with the requirements in their initial phases (90 days). This module has to be done, and the report has to be sent to the grantee, by tomorrow. Please help.

This issue is with the system, not with a particular condition. When I select the key finding, the drop down to place the condition should only list the conditions related to the key finding and they should only be in the initial phase (90). I have to place several conditions, and they each need separate entries with the information about why they are being placed. The conditions are:

1-Required and Additional Health Services-90-a. Providing and Documenting Services within Scope of Project
2-Clinical Staffing-90-f. Credentialing and Privileging of Contracted or Referral Providers
3-Sliding Fee Discount Program-90-j. Sliding Fee for Column III Services

Good Evening Charleta and Dewitt,

It was good speaking with you today. As discussed, the following two 90 conditions were applied to the health center's H80 grant, due to the findings from the vOSV, which occurred 1/27/2021 - 1/29/2021:


1.       Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation-c. Accurate Documentation of Sites within Scope of Project: Within 90 days, provide documentation that the health center has corrected its scope of project and that all service sites within the HRSA-approved scope of project are now accurately recorded in HRSA's Electronic Handbooks (EHB) on the health center's Form 5B: Service Sites. Please see Chapter 6: Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation of the Health Center Program Compliance Manual(https://www.bphc.hrsa.gov/programrequirements/compliancemanual/index.html<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.bphc.hrsa.gov%2fprogramrequirements%2fcompliancemanual%2findex.html&c=E,1,HBCO8-d9bKwvkiSfEE50TIFVSJrMymDImB7wWp5Y9ZhzxlyUWvVCi6jWSvVxJFqjO9hqo-pa_HSTR-wZoH_FH1CEPifZvN6XUZvG2TZpcMf5a1Q34RE,&typo=1&ancr_add=1>) for additional information and contact your project officer with any questions. (45 CFR 75.207(a) and 45 CFR 75.371)

*         Form 5B is not an accurate reflection of all active sites in scope. Primary One Health, located at 1251 Bryden Rd., Columbus, OH 43205 (Site ID: BPS-H80-027456), is not a service delivery site as defined by HRSA and should not be included on Form 5B. HRSA reviewed documentation via a Correspondence Request and compliance for this element was not demonstrated.

2.       Required and Additional Health Services-a. Providing and Documenting Services within Scope of Project: Within 90 days, provide documentation that the health center is providing access to all required health services and that required and any additional service(s) are accurately recorded on Form 5A: Services Provided. If the health center is not currently providing access to the service(s) OR the change(s) in scope required to correct Form 5A is not yet approved and verified, provide an action plan detailing the steps the health center will take to implement the provision of all required services and/or correct Form 5A. Acceptance of this plan by HRSA will result in a condition, which provides 120 days for the health center to submit documentation that it is providing access to the required service(s) and/or has corrected its Form 5A. Please see Chapter 4: Required and Additional Health Services of the Health Center Program Compliance Manual (https://www.bphc.hrsa.gov/programrequirements/compliancemanual/index.html<https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2fwww.bphc.hrsa.gov%2fprogramrequirements%2fcompliancemanual%2findex.html&c=E,1,WYjvxQGIlMe3TroVxNIj34JXks1Or7zgSSxyzj_nSpA0qXGwmQ6Z9VPkzFourvD-litM4eSQ1JNI_f11q1FoZGDnNjMRoc-DVVqbhMZXZk522rF4qI8z&typo=1&ancr_add=1>) for additional information and contact your project officer with any questions, including the applicable component(s) requiring corrective action. (45 CFR 75.207(a) and 45 CFR 75.371)

*         Remove from Column III: Well Child Services - All well child services are provided directly, and no formal referral agreement is required or exists. Additional Services: Remove from Column I: Recuperative Care Services - at the time of the VOSV, the center was not providing recuperative care services. As a result, this requirement was found to be out of compliance. HRSA reviewed documentation via a Correspondence Request and compliance for this element was not demonstrated.
Both condition responses are due in the EHB, by 07/05/2021 (90 days from the attached NOA date of issuance). As we discussed, you are strongly encouraged to submit the necessary documentation in the EHB to initiate the removal of the 90-day program conditions as soon as possible, but no later than the 90 day deadline.
In regards to Accessible Locations and Hours of Operation-c. Accurate Documentation of Sites within Scope of Project, I advised the health center to move forward with submitting a condition response in the EHB as soon as possible, since the health center already received notice (via NOA) that the site located at 1251 Bryden Rd., Columbus, OH, was removed from its scope of project (form B).
As discussed, the health center will need to provide documentation when responding to the condition in the EHB, indicating that the health center has corrected its scope of project and that all service sites within the HRSA-approved scope of project are now accurately recorded in HRSA's Electronic Handbooks (EHB) on the health center's Form 5B: Service Sites.
You can demonstrate compliance by submitting a letter, denoting that the health center has corrected its scope of project and that all service sites within the HRSA-Approved scope of project are now accurately recorded on the health center's form 5B (if this is the case), along w/ a copy of the NOA denoting that the site located at Bryden Rd. was removed from the health center's scope of project.
In regards to the condition:  Required and Additional Health Services-a. Providing and Documenting Services within Scope of Project, the health center submitted a CIS to remove recuperative care from column I, since recuperative care services are not currently provided directly. Note that the CIS request will soon be processed.
Once recuperative care is deleted from the health center's scope of project (form 5A), PrimaryOne Health can demonstrate compliance, by responding with a signed letter stating that the health center is providing access to all required health services and that required and any additional service(s) are accurately recorded on Form 5A: Services Provided, (if this is the case). Include w/ the submission, the NOA denoting that recuperative care was deleted from the health center's scope of project (once you receive the NOA). *The signed letter should also address well child services. Specifically, the health center should provide information about the current well child services --service delivery method and provide the formal referral agreement(s), if you disagree w/ deleting column III for this service (from the health center's form 5A).
Lastly, please note that the Health Center Program Support line (877-464-4772) has requested that you reach out to them directly to request technical assistance regarding locating the condition tasks in the EHB.
Please reach out to me if you have any questions regarding this email.

My title before I became disabled was Director of Adolescent Addiction Services.

Can we have DMI investigate and advise on the below from Vera?

In further reviewing these NoAs, the batching process also caused the funding in Box 33. Future Recommended Support ? Year 4 to be changed to $0.  All six of these grantees received a Type 4 extension that was batched by you and the contractor had to add the future funding period and dollar amount on the back end.

 I just had started to make corrections on these awards and now want to determine if the contractor wants to do the corrections so they can better analyze the problem.  The only item I have touched so far is the legislative authority citation on the Kagman award.

Both of these issues- the recommended future support and the legislative citation associated with batching must be corrected before we do the batching for the balance of funds actions for the H80  January and February start awards.   

Here is an example:

"CHGME awardees/grantees received both precertification and certification tasks within the EHB. Both tasks were sent to the incorrect user, not the AO that certified the CHGME initial application during the same year. Most were sent to the PD and others to non-CHGME users within the organization. The pre-certification and certification of the pre-certification and certification tasks are therefore incorrect and inconsistent with the other documentation include in the FTE assessments. Basically, the wrong person, the person without authority pre-certified/certified the task. Therefore, these completed tasks need to be deleted/scrubbed from the EHB."

Date of Incident: 4/13
Brief Detailed Description:  Good morning. We have been contacted by someone at HRSA that our CEO is appearing in the EHB 27 times as Authorized Official. We are requesting assistance cleaning up our users and roles. Notably, we want to be sure that if we remove an instance of our CEO appearing 27 times, that this wouldn't remove her from listing as AO on the actual grant/award/submission. We are also concerned others could be listed multiple times and multiple roles. Can you advise as to how I can streamline / fix our users and roles without impacting an existing award? 
Thank you in advance for any assistance. - Sam Halloran hallorans@bnhc.org
Steps to Replicate: User is stating Susan Joss is appearing on the users list 27 times should only appear once. Emailed user to get a screenshot of the error, user could not provide that, I found their organizations Primary AO Linda Gabruk and logged in as them to acquire a screenshot. (screenshot attached) Not sure on how to get those items removed from the list, if the user selects remove would that remove the user completely.

Also, I noticed that her role selections within the grant folder search are limited. She should be able to select all roles.

Shelita should have grantor access to the EHBs, as well as administrative access to the PTR, RSR, ADR, and ADR web applications. Would you ask O&M to look into her permissions please?"

The 2019 reporting period for the RSR is now listed as active. It should only be 2020. Was this due to the update on the HIVQM which is attached to the RSR? We have confirmed this through screensharing with a recipient. They can still access everything as normal but everyone?s report inboxes default to the 2019 reports. This will cause confusion for recipients and other reporting requirements involved with RSR such as the CARES Act data entry.

"Hello,

The PQC approved the site visit report. What is supposed to happen is EHB pulls the external site visit report into the module, which is then sent to the grantee. There is a known malfunction with this process, but when I used it two weeks ago, it worked. Below is the EHB-generated email that the grantee received this morning with only the cover letter (no report). What does initiating mean?

Please find the final site visit report for H80CS06674 (Initiating). The details of the site visit are as follows.

Organization Name, City, State: Los Angeles Christian Health Centers, LOS ANGELES, CA
Entity Number:H80CS06674 (Initiating)

Additional Comments:
BPHC requests a standard, comprehensive Operational Site Visit (OSV) to thoroughly review the financial, clinical, and admin/governance operations at the health center and to assess health center compliance with Health Center Program Requirements. The OSV also should evaluate the health centers clinical performance and provide recommendations for performance improvement pertaining to the health centers clinical performance.

"I am writing to inquire about the Scholarships for Disadvantaged (SDS) Program, offered through HRSA Health Workforce. Specifically, I am interested in learning how to add the Orthotics and Prosthetics discipline as an eligible applicant/recipient, and offer the following facts to support inclusion in this program:
? Since 2013, Prosthetics and Sensory Aids Services (PSAS) obligations have increased by 67%. In that same time period, the number of veterans served by PSAS has increased by 21%. In 2019, approximately 55% of all veterans treated by the VHA received devices provided by PSAS, a substantial number of which received devices and services provided by orthotic and prosthetic practitioners.*
? The need for qualified orthotists and prosthetists is projected to grow 17% in the next 10 years, much faster than the average for all occupations (4%)**.
? The fast growth will result in approximately 1,700 new jobs over the 10-year period**; however, that number only represents new openings and does not account for the attrition created by current practitioners who will reach retirement age, which will add approximately 1,500 more jobs by 2029.    
? The discipline serves a diverse population with unique and specialized needs, and therefore requires a highly skilled and trained practitioner. In 2012, in recognition of the increasingly complex knowledge and skillset needed of practitioners, the profession raised the entry-level education requirement from a bachelor?s degree to a master?s degree. 
? Currently, only 12 institutions nationally offer the entry-level educational degree (master?s), with an average cost of in-state tuition of $57,038 and an average out-of-state tuition of $69,092; tuition ranges from a low of $33,3570 to a high of $105,789***. It is important to note that these costs represent tuition and fees only. 
? Programs are typically full-time and cohort based. The required curriculum includes didactic, laboratory, and clinical rotation experiences, thereby necessitating small cohort sizes.
? There is a critical need for greater diversity in the profession, yet the cost of tuition is prohibitive to potential students from disadvantaged backgrounds who would otherwise qualify for admission into the programs.      

The International Institute of Orthotics and Prosthetics (IIOP) was founded in 2016 and is the profession?s only independent O&P educational facility. Enrollment has steadily increased since its first cohort started in January 2019 and is expected to accommodate two new cohorts (24 students per cohort) each academic year, with a total enrollment of 72 students enrolled concurrently in the 16-month program.
? IIOP tuition is $51,993 and is below the average cost of other programs? in-state tuition. IIOP tuition is the same for all students, whether in-state (Florida) or out-of-state.
? IIOP serves as a testing center for the American Board of Certification of Orthotics, Prosthetics and Pedorthics; 200 practitioner candidates spend 32 days each year validating their knowledge and skills through the comprehensive certification exam process.  
? IIOP is located in the Tampa Bay (Florida) area and is within miles of major O&P providers, such as Shriners Hospital for Children, James A. Haley Veteran?s Hospital, and Bay Pines VA Healthcare System. Our partnerships reach across the United States, enabling our students to minimize the cost of their clinical experiences through placements in their home states (e.g., Children?s Healthcare of Atlanta, and the Hanger Clinic). 
? The master?s program at IIOP is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP), and the National Commission of Orthotic and Prosthetic Education (NCOPE). The institute is currently seeking accreditation through the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges (ACCSC).    
? IIOP is home to the Veterans Stride Foundation, a non-profit organization that serves as a resource center for educators, researchers, practitioners, and patients. The Foundations seeks to improve the lives of amputees, veterans, and their families by enhancing the capacity and effectiveness of the practitioners who serve them.  The Foundation sponsors adaptive sports and events in the community to enhance the lives of amputees and veterans.   

I am hopeful that the information provided above is adequate justification for adding the Orthotics and Prosthetics discipline to the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Program. Through this program, we will be able to attract more students from disadvantaged backgrounds and continue to produce highly effective and caring practitioners to those in need. 

Please let me know what the next steps are in this process."

Â·         SV-008546 pertains to LAL ? Edgewater System?s Performance Improvement site visit. The site visit task includes fiscal, clinical and governance TA on the same Performance Improvement Site visit module. Note however, it was determined by the leadership team that SV-008546 had to be cancelled and 3 separate TA types were created for clinical, governance and fiscal (see attachment). As such, SV-008546 is invalid.

Â·         SV-009297 pertains to LAL ? Edgewater System?s site visit that was initially postponed by the program office due to the pandemic. Edgewater?s vOSV was tentatively rescheduled for June 23-25, 2021 (as reflected in the ONHS-NMD site visit plan). SV-009297 however remains in my task queue.

Â·         SV-008549 pertains to Ironton Lawrence County?s site visit, which was initially postponed by the program office, due to the pandemic. Ironton Lawrence County?s vOSV was tentatively rescheduled for June 2- 4, 2021 (as reflected in the ONHS-NMD site visit plan). SV-008549 however remains in my task queue.


The below screenshot provides the grant #s associated with each of the 3 site visit tasks. 

 
I have copied my Team Lead (Keisha) and COTR (Bradford) on this correspondence.  I?ll await your follow-up.

 
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

"For grant T16MC06956, Task Number DG00004902, a notice of award (NoA) was released on 6/1/21 extending this award without funds (Type 4) until 5/31/2022. 

 

Due to the delay in release of this NoA, the project period end performance report (PPER), task number DG00004902, was released in EHB.

 

As supportive information to this request:

A.     The following 3 grants (in addition to T16MC06956) were extended for 12 months until 5/31/22: T16MC06955, T16MC29831, and T16MC06953.

B.      The following grant was extended for 6 months until 11/30/21: T16MC29833

 

To further supplement email below, previously and as per our expectation, the usual process has been to:

1.       extend the reporting period through to the end of the extension; and

2.       have grantee report performance data, for the last year and through to the extension end date, through a PPER.

 

If this usual process were followed, there would not be an NCC generated and:

A.     For the following 4 grants: T16MC06955, T16MC29831, T16MC06953, and T16MC06956, a PPER covering the reporting period between 6/1/20-5/31/22 would be generated after 6/1/22.

B.      For the following 1 grant: T16MC29833, a PPER covering the reporting period between 6/1/20-11/30/21 would be generated after 12/1/21.

o   NOTE: If an NCC were generated from 6/1/20-5/31/21 as proposed; then a PPER from 6/1/21-11/30/21 would produce incongruent data in this instance.

 

Therefore, this request is for Tier 2 or 3 to:

1.       Administratively close PPER (DG00004902) for grant T16MC06956

2.       Confirm status of performance reports to be created for the five T16 (Type 4) grants on extensions above.

3.       Confirm periods of performance to be covered within performance reports for the five T16 (Type 4) grants on extensions above.

""Hi Hanad,

Thank you for the feedback. I spoke with the recipient regarding this item. The recipient is unable to request an extension. I believe this is because the deadline for this submission was established as a ""hard"" deadline due to HRSA/HAB policy.

Is it possible for you to override this in EHB and allow the recipient to request an extension in order to resubmit? Please advise. Thank you.

I would like the new deadline to be 24-48 hours after the portal is made available.

Hello Jasmine,
I was looking back through my emails and noticed Juana Rodriguez is no longer the contact for Youngstown State University Nurse Corps Scholarship Program.
In the past, our office would send an invoice (see attached) to Juana's inbox and she would respond with a net amount (after taxes) to be awarded to the student(s).
Please let me know if you are aware of this process... Or if the process has changed, are you able to advise the next step necessary to determine the scholarship funds.
Please let me know if you have any questions. Many thanks!

"Hi IT team, 

We received additional funding for the U1C program in the recent FY21 Consolidated Appropriations act. Based on that funding increase, we need to extend the period of performance for the 8th research center, U1CRH20419. As you can see in the attached screen print, I was able to add this grant to the NCC but the default project period still ends 8/31/21. 

Do we need to change the project period now? Can we proceed with the NCC and change the project period for this recipient when we issue the NCC funding memo? The project period for U1CRH20419 will be extended until 8/31/2024. Either changing it now or changing it later is fine, I want to check with Tier 2 about the best way to implement the change. 

Thank you for your help.

I had computer issues when entering information into Reporting period 2 of the PRF. Therefore I am not sure of what data was supposed to be pre-populated from reporting period 1, into reporting period 2. 
I have called on this several times, and have received conflicting information, as well as seeing different information in the guides, within the portal and on HRSA's website. 

Since the period of availability for each reporting period goes back to January 1, 2020, I am not sure whether or not the expenses that were reported in period one, were carried forward into period 2 (Pre-populated into period 2). 

I am respectfully requesting advanced assistance on this, as my multiple calls have not provided clear answers. I have received different answers, from different customer service representatives.

For instance, the 'Health Center' may be 'City of Springfield, Massachusetts' and has a grant number 'H80CS00001'. There are multiple health center sites such as 'City of Springfield Adolescent Health Center', 'Craig's Door', 'Franklin County Emergency Shelter'. 

When Health Centers report that they have telehealth in their organization, does this mean that all the sites they manage have telehealth or that at least one site has telehealth? I would greatly appreciate your help. Thank you."

Detailed description of the Issue

Description

Hello, I am the project officer for MIECHV grant X10MC32211, the awardee is Prevent Child Abuse North Dakota.

The DGIS task number is DG00001661, and this is a New Competing Performance Report for the grant.

Financial Form 1 of the report, Line 2, Unobligated balance, states ?$600,000? which is incorrect. This value should be zero. Can you please update the value to zero?

 

I mistakenly approved this report when it was submitted and did not see the erroneous value.

I believe that updating Line 2 UOB to zero will change other related values in the report:

Form 1 - 5. Total Project Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045), 7. Total Collaborative Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045)

Form 2 ? the table showing Unobligated balance (change from 600,000 to zero), Total Project Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045), Total Federal Collaborative Funds (change from 1,807,045 to 1,207,045)

However, if the cascading fields do not update automatically, can you please change those values as well?

Please let me know if you have any additional questions. Thank you!

Hi Nicole,

It is in my queue, but I can't edit it.
See screenshots below.  When I click on ""edit"", it opens it up, and I can see the entire report, but I can only view, not edit.  The other clue is that when I click ""edit"", the tab that opens up is titled ""print report"", which is consistent with how it's acting.

Hi Nicole,

I see now that the change from 784 to 748 looks suspicious (!) and like a mistake, but it was intentional.  We had one site close down as of December 31, 2020 which decreased our capacity by 36 families.  I put a comment about it in the comments section (I'll copy the comment below).

One of our PAT agencies closed as of 12/31/2020. This reduced our staffing by 6 (4 home visitors, 1 clinical supervisor and 1 program manager, counted here under ""other""). It reduced our over program capacity by 36, from 784 households to 748 households.

I can see that the report is still live in the handbook-- is there anything else you want me to add?  Or should I just submit it again?

Connie

Tracking Number: 00279035

Grant Number: H76HA07485

Date of Incident: 01/15/2021

Brief Detailed Description: Grantee stated that her PO told her that he/she has extended their RFI Instruction submission due date to 01/19/2021 however when she logged into her EHB to access the report, she is unable to edit it because the report is passed the due date.

Steps to Replicate: When I logged into her account via OS, the report was showing a different due date (01/19/2021) so I advised her to switch browsers from chrome but the due date was still 1/13/2021 when she switched to IE. I looked it up in production, the due date was 01/13/2021 so I consulted Tier 2 and agent Evrard advised me to escalate it. (screenshots attached)

Description:

Grantee states she is trying to validate the last entry in the INDGEN-PY section of her Performance Report.  She is receiving an error message that another user has already updated the section and that the current data has been loaded to the page. The error won't let her save and validate to proceed with the report. She is receiving the error in the INDGEN-PY

Replicate:

Logged into Testing/OS and confirmed that the INDGEN-PY Section is the only section that is incomplete.

Conducted Screenshare with Grantee.  In the INDGEN-PY section, all the rows have complete data except Row 124.  The Grantee entered data for Columns 13,14,16,17, and 18, though when Save and Validate is selected, a validation error appears that Columns 13,14, 16, 17, 18 need data entered (even though data was just entered).

Tried entering N/A for all fields for Row 124 to bypass the row and same error message results.

Restarted computer and switched browsers and the same error message results.

Added the Grantee's Superviser, Samantha Lawson, also with permission to work on grant, to the screenshare.  Initially she received the same error as above, however she was able to save column 13 and 14 when she clicked Save and Validate.  Columns 16, 17, and 18 are still not saving, when save is clicked.

Also found that in the ""Edit Form"" of the section, the data is visible for all columns for Rows 1 to 123, however, when in ""Review"" mode, the data is not viewable in Columns 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18 for rows 51 to 123.

The submission due date is 3/31/22 and no Extension Request is available in the EHB

Description of Issue:

I am having trouble with a submitted PPER - DG00004944 ? under grant number T76MC00011. I received a blank system e-mail saying the report had been submitted (e-mail attached ? this is similar to an issue flagged by one of my colleagues) and my EHB tasks queue also indicates I have a DGIS performance report to review that is in ?Not Started? status (first screen shot below). However, when I proceed to my DGIS task queue, nothing appears. I have tried to toggle the ?search? setting on the task list to include all FY, all states, all types of reports and nothing shows up that needs review. The only reports that appear are previously submitted/cleared reports from previous reporting periods (see second screen shot below). Am I missing something?

 





 

When I look in the grant folder, it does say the report was submitted and that HRSA Review is ?In Progress? ? but I haven?t been able to locate or start reviewing the report.

 



 

I appreciate any assistance you can provide in resolving this issue.

 

Thanks!
Michelle

"I am a Family Physician at Mee Memorial Healthcare System in King City California which operates a critical access hospital.  As a clinical practitioner, I have little knowledge about grant processes, so I am asking for advice.  In May, 2020, our hospital closed it's labor and deliver unit due to financial strains placed on the institution by the COVID 19 pandemic.  This caused our underserved,  and largely low income Latinx population to have to drive about one hour a hospital in to Salinas, California to receive labor and delivery services or even basic evaluation such as non-stress tests.  Our population often lacks adequate transportation for this journey, and it is just not medically safe for women, who may be bleeding or contracting, to have to travel that distance.  Other physicians and I have spoken to Hospital Administration about reopening the local labor and delivery unit, but we are told that there are financial constraints, including the costs of hiring and staffing with nurses and providing obstetrical coverage with either obstetricians or well-trained Family Practitioners.  We, the physicians, need assistance in navigating this process to see what funds might be available to reopen these services for our needy patient population."

"I recently served as BPHC Representative for a virtual Operational Site Visit at HPM Foundation, Inc. (H80CS00695). Only one non-compliant finding resulted from the OSV, and that finding was later found compliant through the Structured TA Report (STAR) Correspondence Request (CRO) process. There should be no non-compliant findings in the final STAR and no conditions should result from this OSV. When I went into the TATS TA Report module in EHB to download the final PDF version of the approved STAR (TA007079), the one finding still shows as non-compliant (see element b under Sliding Fee Discounts). My leadership requested that HCPS re-open the final STAR to correct this error so that there are no non-compliant findings in it. We also need a new final PDF version of the STAR created so that we can send the final STAR to the health center and close the Site Visit conduct module in EHB. We are supposed to send the final report to the health center within 45 days of the OSV that took place April 27-29 and we are fast approaching that date.

Steps to Replicate: When I logged into grantee's account via OS to replicate the issue, I was able to open up the allocation report section successfully so asked her what browser she is using and she said Google Chrome so I advised her to switch to IE but she encountered the same error. I consulted Tier 2 and agent Hanad advised me to escalate.

"Hi,

Can an individual apply for a grant via your organization?  I have an interest in applying for a grant that would allow consumers of health care to more easily compare prices of health care services/procedures between competitor hospitals.

Hospitals are required to publish a fee schedule for services that is viewable by the public.  These fee schedules are based on procedure codes that the general public is not familiar with,  and the presentation of such fees schedules varies hospital to hospital.  It makes it very difficult for a lay consumer to compare competitor hospital prices.  I would like to apply for a grant that would support the building of a mechanism accessible by the general public that breaks down competitor hospital fee schedules at a level where the coding is translated to an index health care consumers can understand, and that aligns mutually exclusive hospital fee schedules by service for an easier comparison between two or more hospitals.

The mechanism I have in mind would be an interactive database at a website holding all hospital fee schedules, where a consumer could select specific hospital names or designate a geographical service area (most likely by county or zip), and then be presented with an indexed, decipherable fee schedule with each hospital going across the columns and the service/procedure types as the rows.  The data would be each hospital?s fee.  The procedures would have links where consumers could drill down for more detail.  There would be a defined procedure for updating the database on a routine basis, to control for hospital updates to fee schedules.

The ultimate goal in applying for a grant would be to increase health care service price transparency, which was the driver behind requiring hospitals to provide fee schedules to begin with.  A fringe benefit of creating this mechanism is once the public has the ability to put a hospital?s fee schedule to use, hospitals would be incentivized to provide more price competitive services.  At present, no one is using these fee schedules.  Hospital?s would also have incentive to fill in any holes with regard to services provided on the fee schedule.  There would literally be a null in the data for any hospital service without a provided price estimate (assuming a competitor hospital listed a fee for the service).

I am currently unemployed, but have worked in hospital decision support analytics for almost 20 years.  I have a friend who is a coding guru and we would like to team up for this.  We both are excited at the prospect of pursuing this project as it would be groundbreaking in transitioning power to the health care consumer.

Thanks for your help and any insight!

"Good morning,	

My name is Morgan and when I came across your website, I was very impressed! A mesothelioma diagnosis comes with many complications. Aside from the cancer itself, other problems like mental health can make the process even more complicated. The most common mental health conditions in cancer patients include anxiety, depression, and coping issues. A study by Psycho-Oncology found nearly 25 percent of cancer patients experience symptoms of depression. Sadly, 75% of cancer-related suicides are patients with depression. 

It's important for patients and their families to know there are support groups and other resources to help them in their time of need. Studies show that cancer patients and their families who utilize therapy and support groups are less likely to turn to substance abuse or self-harm. For these reasons, we would love to be featured on your site. So please, let me know if you would add www.mesotheliomahub.com/mesothelioma/complications/mental-effects/ to your page; mchb.hrsa.gov/whusa13/health-status/health-indicators/p/life-expectancy.html, with the anchor text ?Mesothelioma & Depression.? I think our website could be a beneficial resource for your visitors.

"Hello, 
I am a former employee from an FQHC in Grand Junction, CO; MarillacHealth. I had suspicions that the organization was misusing funds, specifically the School based health center grant. I have a few questions regarding both grants and the organization. 
1. Are FQHC board meetings open to employees and the public? My understanding is that as a public entity, those meetings are. I repeatedly asked to attend these meetings and was denied access. My intentions were to listen to what false information was being reported to the board. 

2. How does HRSA check on the organization following grant guidelines? My complaint was that we were hired and paid through the SBHC grant, yet we were doing tasks for the clinic which was outside of the SBHC grant. I did verify with the state of Colorado that this was a violation of grant guidelines. 

3. How do I submit any complaints to HRSA regarding the mishandling of funding and discrimination treatment I received at my employment, resulting in my unfair termination?

43 What are the rules for contacting the Media regarding these allegations, as well as the results of the state audit for such mishandling of funds which affect students the grant was meant to serve?
If someone could please get in touch with me and fist answer these in writing and then call if needed, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Respectfully,

BPHC is only funding 25 of over 300 applications for 21-093. This competition was very competitive with scores being a one-hundredth of a point apart.  But, this would mean all funded would have a score of 100 or 99.

Double checking to make sure  we can give BPHC assurance that we have validated both normalized ROLs before they decide if they will use the normalized or raw version for making awards. We want to make sure that there were no weird z-score anomalies for the EHB or ARM ROLs for HRSA-21-093 due to the number of applications with scores over 100 on the EHB ROL. 

 

Both the EHB and ARM normalized ROLs are attached to this email. I will need your verification by tomorrow if at all possible and I thank you for your help.

Please fix Form 2 of Tracking No. 181072 (NonCompeting Continuation Report) for Grant No. H18MC0001 (see below) .

Should there be a ""Form 2"" section for the performance report submission?  Budget (Section 2) refers to information that is pre-populated from Form 2- Project Funding Profile, however I do not have this section to update and there is no pre-populated data.

I wanted to know if I have eligible for this reward if applied. I was hired 2/24/2020 and I believe the application stated it is a two year contract.

Grant Number: H80CS00244

Date of Incident:03/02/201

Brief Detailed Description: Grantee needed assistance with creating an account however the system says her username (vmiles@rphcc.org) already exist so she created an account using an alternative email address (Vlmiles03@gmail.com) and when she tried to update her email address, the system says there is an account with her email (vmiles@rphcc.org).

Steps to Replicate: I searched for an account for the user by the email address and found an account under Kim Taylor so I asked user if she knew Kim and she said yes. I reset the password to her email (vmiles@rphcc.org) and she logged into the EHB but she was prompted to register to the organization however she got a warning that she cannot register to the organization. Vera informed me that Taylor has been removed from the organization therefore the email address ((vmiles@rphcc.org) has been removed and if she needs to register to the organization with that username, it would have to be added back to the organization. Vera needs her email available to her so she can update her alternative email (Vlmiles03@gmail.com) address to her work email. Marie advised me to escalate it.

"Hello, 
We are greatly concerned that EHB will be unavailable the entire weekend just 10 days before the UDS due date and ask that HRSA reconsiders this shut down time in light of the need for grantees to work in EHB over the weekend before such a major deadline. 

Like all health centers Trillium Health has been dealing with the strain of COVID, vaccine distribution, staff shortages due to illness and now particularly related to vaccine side effects. Because of these factors our typical timeline and staffing for doing the UDS this year has been impacted and we had hoped to do work over this weekend to upload data in EHB to gain back some ground. We like to upload the data and work on all the cross table edits before our C-suite staff review the submission. this way nothing, or only minor data changes are made between their review and our submission. 

As you can imagine, learning that the EHB is closed all weekend in this context is very stressful for us and so I wanted to take a few minutes to share this frustration with you that a major EHB outage would be planned before such a major Health Centre deadline. 

If there is a way to postpone this EHB update until after the UDS is due that would be ideal or conduct the update in over-night times possibly. 

Respectfully, 
Amy Mihalakas

"Hello,

I have a general question regarding subawards.  I have a PI that is a dual employee (co-funded between the University and the hospital).  They have been given a HRSA grant through the University, however, part of the scope of work will be conducted at the hospital.  The PI wants to know if they can use a subaward to ""sub"" the work to themselves to complete the portion of work completed at the hospital.  In this scenario, they would be listed as the PI for the University and as the PI for the Subaward.  I believe this would be a conflict of interest, because the PI would be approving their own invoices/work produced from the hospital, however, I'm unable to find any clear guidance in your policy manual that discusses this specific situation.  

I've also read through Uniform Guidance.  Any help is greatly appreciated.
Thank you,
Tiffany"

"I am currently applying for a school-specific scholarship, and its basis has to do with being from a medically underserved area. I have used two sites for determination, but they have conflicting information:
https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/mua-find
and
https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/by-address

(address if for 8 Tremont Street in Hartford, CT)

I have noticed that finding by address uses geocoding, which the site itself deems as not 100% accurate. 
The geocoding shows that this is not an MUA, but the mua-find shows that Hartford is. 

Would someone be able to tell me which would be the best tool to use, and if there is any additional information that HRSA can provide?

My name is Michelle and I am a PA in Iowa.  I currently work in a critical access hospital in Sioux County, IA.  The hospital tells me they are approved for HRSA.  Can you tell me what the ""Need"" number is for this area and if it is worth filling out the application?  Several years ago I filled this out and it literally took me and my husband both working on it for several hours over a week to get it done just to find out that my site had it's need number lowered after I turned it in.  That was so disappointing.  The name of the town I am in is Hawarden, Iowa, if that is helpful.

I would really like to hear back from you.

I wonder if you would be able to share these 2012 and 2013 NPI files that we need for a research project at the RAND Corporation. We have a FTP site that allows data transmission. Thanks a lot!

Grantee wants be to sure that the fields in the report already completed are not erased during the edit.

 

The Core 1/Tier 2 objectives should match the ?aims? in Form 6 but currently there are no aims in Form 6 or objectives in Core 1.

 

The goal is that these aims/objectives are pulled from the NOFO and consistent across programs (for Form 6 and Core 1 objectives) . It does not look like the back-end pre-population happened with programs that were mid-project period when the new DGIS rolled out.

 

Would you be able to input goals/aims in Form 6 and corresponding aims and objectives from the attachment into the report or edit the permissions so the grantee can enter them?"

Ticket was escalated already 

A Project in our ARP (Capital) Grant was changed from Alteration/ Renovation to Construction/Expansion. 
The correction was made on project 190779-10, but the site froze while working on Form 5B, picking a site from scope and the site was not added.
When I tried to add the site again, it said the site was already in use, although it was not showing up.
So I deleted project 190779-10 and created 190779-11. But I still cannot add the project site, because it still says it is already in use.

I think there is something in the queue or someplace else that shows the site is being used even through it is not.

The site I need to add to 190779-11 is 3136 West Street.
The other two sites are okay as they are (3158 West St and 1151 Washington St)."

I have a question regarding submitting progress reports.

We?ve had a lot of turnover organizationally among the grants/development team, so I?m wondering if the attachment got lost somewhere. Any clarity would be appreciated."

We need to add an additional validation to the EHE Triannual Module.

New Validation: If (column A + column B) > column C then the following error message should appear on UI:


<<The sum of the number of clients reported in columns (A) and (B) must be less than or equal to column (C) for the following row(s): <list of row numbers comma separated>>

Thanks so much.

"Elon Musk is a visionary and he is well knowned to have the midas touch. Anything he tweets or gets involved in, goes up in prices.

Elon Musk caused Bitcoin's price to soar when he tweeted about it.

The most important question everyone has is: ""what is next?""

The short answer is a newly listed NASDAQ crypto mining company from Canada.

Rumours have it that Elon Musk or Tesla might have or is going to acquire a stake in this newly listed NASDAQ.

Many are waiting for his ""infamous"" tweets to send stock price soaring.

With all the talk about going green, this newly listed Bitcoin and Ethereum mining company is a green company that mines bitcoin and ethereum using green energy.

It is currently trading at less than USD$3.50 in NASDAQ, way lower than it's all time high in 2018. And Bitcoin and Ethereum have broken their all time high, making this stock highly undervalued.

This company is Canadian company Hive Blockchain. You can check out their stock here:
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/hvbtf

Rumours have it that Elon Musk or Tesla has taken a stake in this company which just listed on NASDAQ on 1st July 2021.

"I serve as the Project Officer on Grant Number X10MC33612.  I am submitting this request on behalf of the awardee, the Utah Department of Health.

 

During HRSA?s review of Utah?s FY19 MIECHV Final Report, the awardee changed MIECHV Project Directors.  The former PD is Kat Bark.  The new PD is Elizabeth Vansant-Webb. 

 

The former PD submitted the original version of the report, but it is up to the new PD to make revisions and upload the final version of the report.  The final version of the report is now due for submission in response to my EHB Change Request (see screen shot below).  However, the new PD does not have ?submission? privileges because EHB still lists the former PD as FY19 award PD and as the only person who can submit documents for that grant.  

 

The Utah Authorizing Official (AO) tried to submit the report, but was told that the listed PD (former PD Kat Bark) must first grant access to the AO.  However, neither the former nor the previous PD are comfortable with the former PD (who is now a HRSA employee) logging into her old Utah account.

 

Next, Utah attempted to submit a PAR to make Elizabeth Vansant-Webb the PD for the FY19 award, as she has done for the FY20 and FY21 awards.  However, EHB won?t let her submit a PAR because the FY19 is an inactive grant.  Here is the message she received when she tried:

 

Grant Number X10MC33612 expired on 09/29/2021 and a Prior Approval Request for a Project Director Change may not be requested. For questions, please contact the Grants Management Specialist listed on the Notice of Award.

 

Is it possible for Tier 2 Support to update Elizabeth Vansant-Webb?s EHB account to indicate her as the PD for Grant Number X10MC33612 or otherwise enable her to submit the final version of the report? 

 

Thank you, and please let me know if you need more information.

Detailed Description of the issue:
The North/Central Florida GWEP team funded by Grant Number U1QHP28709 has ""junk characters"" in the PC-1, LR-1a, LR-2, DV-1, DV-2, and DV-3 sections for our training programs. Although we are still able to enter data and have the EHB save it, we are unable to validate each section in the APR entirely because of this issue, which we need to do prior to final submission.  

While doing a test population on our Performance Data Forms for this year, we also noticed that the inactive training programs from last GWEP cycle have disappeared. This seemed odd because multiple members of our team remember seeing them in the EHB system last week. The programs generating the junk characters seem to be current REACH training programs. 

We were not experiencing this issue with junk characters last week while working on the initial setup for our training programs. When the EHB system deleted the inactive entries from last GWEP cycle this past week, this issue may have arisen around the same time.

Please see screenshot attached"

I'm trying to upload and submit the PR Primary Care Needs Assessment, and the ""place"" where you provide me to upload and submit it was already used.  It says that the document was already submitted.  It seems it was used by another individual by mistake.

Your SEO?s working.

You?re getting eyeballs ? mine at least.

Your content?s pretty good, wouldn?t change a thing.

BUT?

Eyeballs don?t pay the bills.

CUSTOMERS do.

And studies show that 7 out of 10 visitors to a site like hrsa.gov will drop by, take a gander, and then head for the hills without doing anything else.

It?s like they never were even there.

You can fix this.

This is the 4th year in our grant performance period and for the past 3 years we have submitted an NCC report in Mid-March.
